      "Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome . [ 1 ] The Stoics believed that the practice of virtue is enough to achieve eudaimonia : a well-lived life. The Stoics identified the path to achieving it with a life spent practicing the four virtues in everyday life—wisdom, courage, temperance or moderation, and justice—as well as living in accordance with nature. It was founded in the ancient Agora of Athens by Zeno of Citium around 300 BCE.\n",
      "Alongside Aristotle's ethics , the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics . [ 2 ] The Stoics are especially known for teaching that \"virtue is the only good\" for human beings, and that external things, such as health, wealth, and pleasure, are not good or bad in themselves ( adiaphora ) but have value as \"material for virtue to act upon\". Many Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus —emphasized that because \"virtue is sufficient for happiness \", a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis ) that is \"in accordance with nature \". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. [ 3 ] To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they believed everything was rooted in nature.\n",
      "Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century CE, and among its adherents was Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius . It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century CE. Since then, it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance ( Neostoicism ) and in the contemporary era ( modern Stoicism ). [ 4 ]\n",
      "Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood, and that of statuary bronze, so the subject-matter of the art of living is each person's own life.\n",
      "The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, constructed from ideals of logic , monistic physics and naturalistic ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.\n",
      "Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions ; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason ( logos ). Stoicism's primary aspect involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: \" Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature.\" [ 5 ] This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; \"to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy\", [ 6 ] and to accept even slaves as \"equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature\". [ 7 ]\n",
      "The Stoic ethic espouses a deterministic perspective; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue, Cleanthes once opined that the wicked man is \"like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes\". [ 5 ] A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus , \"sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy\", [ 6 ] thus positing a \"completely autonomous\" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is \"a rigidly deterministic single whole\". This viewpoint was later described as \" Classical Pantheism \" (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza ). [ 8 ]\n",
      "The name Stoicism derives from the Stoa Poikile ( Ancient Greek : ἡ ποικίλη στοά), or \"painted porch\", a colonnade decorated with mythic and historical battle scenes on the north side of the Agora in Athens where Zeno of Citium and his followers gathered to discuss their ideas, near the end of the 4th century BC. [ 9 ] Unlike the Epicureans , Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space. Stoicism was originally known as Zenonism. However, this name was soon dropped, likely because the Stoics did not consider their founders to be perfectly wise and to avoid the risk of the philosophy becoming a cult of personality . [ 10 ]\n",
      "Zeno's ideas developed from those of the Cynics (brought to him by Crates of Thebes ), whose founding father, Antisthenes , had been a disciple of Socrates . Zeno's most influential successor was Chrysippus , who followed Cleanthes as leader of the school, and was responsible for molding what is now called Stoicism. [ 11 ] Stoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire [ 12 ] to the point where, in the words of Gilbert Murray , \"nearly all the successors of Alexander [...] professed themselves Stoics\". [ 13 ] Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe within which we are active participants.\n",
      "Scholars [ 14 ] usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases: the Early Stoa, from Zeno's founding to Antipater ; the Middle Stoa, including Panaetius and Posidonius ; and the Late Stoa, including Musonius Rufus , Seneca , Epictetus , and Marcus Aurelius . No complete works survived from the first two phases of Stoicism. Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survived. [ 15 ]\n",
      "Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood, and that of statuary bronze, so the subject-matter of the art of living is each person's own life.\n",
      "Of all the schools of ancient philosophy, Stoicism made the greatest claim to being utterly systematic. [ 16 ] In the view of the Stoics, philosophy is the practice of virtue, and virtue, the highest form of which is utility, is generally speaking, constructed from ideals of logic , monistic physics, and naturalistic ethics. [ 17 ] These three ideals constitute virtue which is necessary for 'living a well reasoned life', seeing as they are all parts of a logos, or philosophical discourse, which includes the mind's rational dialogue with itself. [ 18 ] Of them, the Stoics emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.\n",
      "Stoicism teaches the development of self-control as a means of overcoming destructive emotions ; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason ( logos ). Stoicism's primary aspect involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: \" Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature\". [ 5 ] This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; \"to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy\", [ 6 ] and to accept even slaves as \"equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature\".

[ 5 ] A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus , \"sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy\", [ 6 ] thus positing a \"completely autonomous\" individual will and at the same time a universe that is \"a rigidly deterministic single whole\". This viewpoint was later described as \" Classical Pantheism \" (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza ). [ 19 ]\n",
      "Diodorus Cronus , who was one of Zeno's teachers, is considered the philosopher who first introduced and developed an approach to logic now known as propositional logic , which is based on statements or propositions, rather than terms, differing greatly from Aristotle's term logic . Later, Chrysippus developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system, Stoic Syllogistic, which was considered a rival to Aristotle's Syllogistic (see Syllogism ). New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th century, when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic. Susanne Bobzien wrote, \"The many close similarities between Chrysippus's philosophical logic and that of Gottlob Frege are especially striking\". [ 20 ]\n",
      "Bobzien also notes that, \"Chrysippus wrote over 300 books on logic, on virtually any topic logic today concerns itself with, including speech act theory, sentence analysis, singular and plural expressions, types of predicates , indexicals , existential propositions , sentential connectives , negations , disjunctions , conditionals , logical consequence , valid argument forms, theory of deduction , propositional logic, modal logic , tense logic , epistemic logic , logic of suppositions , logic of imperatives , ambiguity and logical paradoxes \". [ 20 ]\n",
      "The Stoics held that all beings ( ὄντα )—though not all things (τινά)—are material . [ 21 ] Besides the existing beings they admitted four incorporeals  (asomata): time, place, void, and sayable. [ 22 ] They were held to be just 'subsisting' while such a status was denied to universals. [ 23 ] Thus, they accepted Anaxagoras 's idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all accidents . Thus, if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.\n",
      "They held that there were four categories :\n",
      "The Stoics outlined that our own actions, thoughts, and reactions are within our control. The opening paragraph of the Enchiridion states the categories as: \"Some things in the world are up to us, while others are not. Up to us are our faculties of judgment, motivation, desire, and aversion. In short, whatever is our own doing.\" [ 24 ] These suggest a space that is up to us or within our power. A simple example of the Stoic categories in use is provided by Jacques Brunschwig:\n",
      "I am a certain lump of matter, and thereby a substance, an existent something (and thus far that is all); I am a man, and this individual man that I am, and thereby qualified by a common quality and a peculiar one; I am sitting or standing, disposed in a certain way; I am the father of my children, the fellow citizen of my fellow citizens, disposed in a certain way in relation to something else. [ 25 ]\n",
      "The Stoics propounded that knowledge can be attained through the use of reason . Truth can be distinguished from fallacy —even if, in practice, only an approximation can be made. According to the Stoics, the senses constantly receive sensations: pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the mind , where they leave an impression in the imagination ( phantasiai ) (an impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma). [ 26 ]\n",
      "The mind has the ability to judge (συγκατάθεσις, synkatathesis )—approve or reject—an impression, enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false. Some impressions can be assented to immediately, but others can achieve only varying degrees of hesitant approval, which can be labeled belief or opinion ( doxa ). It is only through reason that we gain clear comprehension and conviction ( katalepsis ). Certain and true knowledge ( episteme ), achievable by the Stoic sage, can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one's peers and the collective judgment of humankind.\n",
      "According to the Stoics, the Universe is a material reasoning substance ( logos ), which was divided into two classes: the active and the passive. [ 27 ] The passive substance is matter, which \"lies sluggish, a substance ready for any use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion\". [ 28 ] The active substance is an intelligent aether or primordial fire , which acts on the passive matter:\n",
      "The universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul; it is this same world's guiding principle, operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality that embraces all existence; then the foreordained might and necessity of the future; then fire and the principle of aether; then those elements whose natural state is one of flux and transition, such as water, earth, and air; then the sun, the moon, the stars; and the universal existence in which all things are contained.\n",
      "Everything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs. The souls of humans and animals are emanations from this primordial Fire, and are, likewise, subject to Fate:\n",
      "Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things that exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the structure of the web.\n",
      "Individual souls are perishable by nature, and can be \"transmuted and diffused, assuming a fiery nature by being received into the seminal reason (\" logos spermatikos \") of the Universe\". [ 29 ] Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe.\n",
      "Stoic theology is a fatalistic and naturalistic pantheism : God is never fully transcendent but always immanent , and identified with Nature . Abrahamic religions personalize God as a world-creating entity, but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe; according to Stoic cosmology , which is very similar to the Hindu conception of existence , there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, space and the Universe have neither start nor end, rather they are cyclical. The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed (\" ekpyrōsis \", conflagration ) and re-created again , [ 30 ] and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes. Stoicism considers all existence as cyclical, the cosmos as eternally self-creating and self-destroying (see also Eternal return ).\n",
      "Stoicism does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe. [ 31 ] According to the Stoics, the logos was the active reason or anima mundi pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the seminal reason (\" logos spermatikos \"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate matter . Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine logos , which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe. [ 32 ]\n",
      "The foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself, in wisdom and self-control. One must therefore strive to be free of the passions . For the Stoics, reason meant using logic and understanding the processes of nature—the logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. [ 33 ] The Greek word pathos was a wide-ranging term indicating an infliction one suffers. [ 34 ] The Stoics used the word to discuss many common emotions such as anger, fear and excessive joy. [ 35 ] A passion is a disturbing and misleading force in the mind which occurs because of a failure to reason correctly. [ 34 ]\n",
      "For the Stoic Chrysippus , the passions are evaluative judgements. [ 36 ] A person experiencing such an emotion has incorrectly valued an indifferent thing. [ 37 ] A fault of judgement, some false notion of good or evil, lies at the root of each passion. [ 38 ] Incorrect judgement as to a present good gives rise to delight, while lust is a wrong estimate about the future. [ 38 ] Unreal imaginings of evil cause distress about the present, or fear for the future. [ 38 ] The ideal Stoic would instead measure things at their real value, [ 38 ] and see that the passions are not natural. [ 39 ] To be free of the passions is to have a happiness which is self-contained. [ 39 ] There would be nothing to fear—for unreason is the only evil; no cause for anger—for others cannot harm you. [ 39 ]\n",
      "The Stoics arranged the passions under four headings: distress, pleasure, fear and lust. [ 40 ] One report of the Stoic definitions of these passions appears in the treatise On Passions by Chrysippus (trans. Long & Sedley, pg. 411, modified):\n",
      "Two of these passions (distress and delight) refer to emotions currently present, and two of these (fear and lust) refer to emotions directed at the future. [ 40 ] Thus there are just two states directed at the prospect of good and evil, but subdivided as to whether they are present or future: [ 41 ] Numerous subdivisions of the same class were brought under the head of the separate passions: [ 42 ]\n",
      "The wise person ( sophos ) is someone who is free from the passions ( apatheia ). Instead the sage experiences good-feelings ( eupatheia ) which are clear-headed. [ 43 ] These emotional impulses are not excessive, but nor are they diminished emotions. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Instead they are the correct rational emotions. [ 45 ] The Stoics listed the good-feelings under the headings of joy ( chara ), wish ( boulesis ), and caution ( eulabeia ). [ 37 ] Thus if something is present which is a genuine good, then the wise person experiences an uplift in the soul—joy ( chara ). [ 46 ] The Stoics also subdivided the good-feelings: [ 47 ]\n",
      "The Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life, [ 48 ] such as if they fell victim to severe pain or disease, [ 48 ] but otherwise suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one's social duty. [ 49 ] For example, Plutarch reports that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised Cato 's self-consistency ( constantia ) as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices. [ 50 ]\n",
      "A distinctive feature of Stoicism is its cosmopolitanism ; according to the Stoics, all people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should live in brotherly love and readily help one another. In the Discourses , Epictetus comments on man's relationship with the world: \"Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, whereof the city political is only a copy.\" [ 51 ] This sentiment echoes that of Diogenes of Sinope , who said, \"I am not an Athenian or a Corinthian , but a citizen of the world.\" [ 52 ]\n",
      "They held that external differences, such as rank and wealth, are of no importance in social relationships. Instead, they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco-Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as Cato the Younger and Epictetus.\n",
      "In particular, they were noted for their urging of clemency toward slaves . Seneca exhorted, \"Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies.\" [ 53 ]\n",
      "Plotinus criticized both Aristotle's Categories and those of the Stoics. His student Porphyry , however, defended Aristotle's scheme. He justified this by arguing that they be interpreted strictly as expressions, rather than as metaphysical realities. The approach can be justified, at least in part, by Aristotle's own words in The Categories. Boethius ' acceptance of Porphyry's interpretation led to their being accepted by Scholastic philosophy. [ citation needed ]\n",
      "The Fathers of the Church regarded Stoicism as a \"pagan philosophy\"; [ 54 ] [ 55 ] nonetheless, early Christian writers employed some of the central philosophical concepts of Stoicism. Examples include the terms \"logos\", \" virtue \", \"Spirit\", and \" conscience \". [ 31 ] But the parallels go well beyond the sharing and borrowing of terminology. Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world, a belief in human kinship with Nature or God, a sense of the innate depravity—or \"persistent evil\"—of humankind, [ 31 ] and the futility and temporary nature of worldly possessions and attachments. Both encourage Ascesis with respect to the passions and inferior emotions, such as lust, and envy, so that the higher possibilities of one's humanity can be awakened and developed. Stoic influence can also be seen in the works of Ambrose of Milan , Marcus Minucius Felix , and Tertullian . [ 56 ]\n",
      "The modern usage is a \"person who represses feelings or endures patiently\". [ 57 ] The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ' s entry on Stoicism notes, \"the sense of the English adjective 'stoical' is not utterly misleading with regard to its philosophical origins\". [ 58 ]\n",
      "The revival of Stoicism in the 20th century can be traced to the publication of Problems in Stoicism [ 59 ] [ 60 ] by A. A. Long in 1971, and also as part of the late 20th-century surge of interest in virtue ethics . Contemporary Stoicism draws from the late 20th- and early 21st-century spike in publications of scholarly works on ancient Stoicism. Beyond that, the current Stoicist movement traces its roots to the work of Albert Ellis , who developed rational emotive behavior therapy , [ 61 ] as well as Aaron T. Beck , who is regarded by many as the father of early versions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n",
      "Stoic philosophy was the original philosophical inspiration for modern cognitive psychotherapy , particularly as mediated by Albert Ellis' Rational-Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT), the major precursor of CBT.  The original cognitive therapy treatment manual for depression by Aaron T. Beck et al. states, \"The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers\". [ 62 ] A well-known quotation from Enchiridion of Epictetus was taught to most clients during the initial session of traditional REBT by Ellis and his followers: \"It's not the events that upset us, but our judgments about the events.\" [ 63 ]\n",
      "This subsequently became a common element in the socialization phase of many other approaches to CBT. The question of Stoicism's influence on modern psychotherapy, particularly REBT and CBT, was described in detail in The Philosophy of Cognitive–Behavioural Therapy by Donald Robertson. [ 63 ] Several early 20th-century psychotherapists were influenced by Stoicism, most notably the \"rational persuasion\" school founded by the Swiss neurologist and psychotherapist Paul Dubois , who drew heavily on Stoicism in his clinical work and encouraged his clients to study passages from Seneca the Younger as homework assignments.\n",
      "Similarities of modern Stoicism and third-wave CBT have been suggested as well, and individual reports of its potency in treating depression have been published. [ 64 ] There has also been interest in applying the tenets of ancient Stoicism to the human origin story, [ 65 ] environmental education, [ 66 ] vegetarianism [ 67 ] and the modern challenges of sustainable development, material consumption and consumerism. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ]\n",
      "Seamus Mac Suibhne has described the practices of spiritual exercises as influencing those of reflective practice . [ 71 ] Many parallels between Stoic spiritual exercises and modern cognitive behavioral therapy have been identified. [ 63 ] According to philosopher Pierre Hadot , philosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims; it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or \" askēsis \"), an active process of constant practice and self-reminder. Epictetus in his Discourses , distinguished between three types of act: judgment, desire, and inclination. [ 72 ] which Hadot identifies these three acts with logic, physics and ethics respectively. [ 73 ] Hadot writes that in the Meditations , \"Each maxim develops either one of these very characteristic topoi [i.e., acts], or two of them or three of them.\" [ 74 ]\n",
      "Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta is a collection by Hans von Arnim of fragments and testimonia of the earlier Stoics, published in 1903–1905 as part of the Bibliotheca Teubneriana . It includes the fragments and testimonia of Zeno of Citium , Chrysippus and their immediate followers. At first the work consisted of three volumes, to which Maximilian Adler in 1924 added a fourth, containing general indices. Teubner reprinted the whole work in 1964.\n"

      "Hedonism is a family of philosophical views that prioritize pleasure . Psychological hedonism is the theory that the underlying motivation of all human behavior is to maximize pleasure and avoid pain . As a form of egoism , it suggests that people only help others if they expect a personal benefit.\n",
      "Axiological hedonism is the view that pleasure is the sole source of intrinsic value . It asserts that other things, like knowledge and money, only have value insofar as they produce pleasure and reduce pain. This view divides into quantitative hedonism, which only considers the intensity and duration of pleasures, and qualitative hedonism, which holds that the value of pleasures also depends on their quality. The closely related position of prudential hedonism states that pleasure and pain are the only factors of well-being .\n",
      "Ethical hedonism applies axiological hedonism to morality , arguing that people have a moral obligation to pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Utilitarian versions assert that the goal is to increase overall happiness for everyone, whereas egoistic versions state that each person should only pursue their own pleasure. Outside the academic context, hedonism is a pejorative term for an egoistic lifestyle seeking short-term gratification.\n",
      "Hedonists typically understand pleasure and pain broadly to include any positive or negative experience . While traditionally seen as bodily sensations, contemporary philosophers tend to view them as attitudes of attraction or aversion toward objects. Hedonists often use the term happiness for the balance of pleasure over pain. The subjective nature of these phenomena makes it difficult to measure this balance and compare it between different people. The paradox of hedonism and the hedonic treadmill are proposed psychological barriers to the hedonist goal of long-term happiness.\n",
      "As one of the oldest philosophical theories, hedonism was discussed by the Cyrenaics and Epicureans in ancient Greece , the Charvaka school in ancient India , and Yangism in ancient China . It attracted less attention in the medieval period but became a central topic in the modern era with the rise of utilitarianism. Various criticisms of hedonism emerged in the 20th century, while its proponents suggested new versions to meet these challenges. Hedonism remains relevant to many fields, ranging from psychology and economics to animal ethics .\n",
      "The term hedonism refers not to a single theory but to a family of theories about the role of pleasure . These theories are often categorized into psychological , axiological , and ethical hedonism depending on whether they study the relation between pleasure and motivation , value , or right action. [ 1 ] While these distinctions are common in contemporary philosophy, earlier philosophers did not always clearly differentiate between them and sometimes combined several views in their theories. [ 2 ] The word hedonism derives from the Ancient Greek word ἡδονή ( hēdonē ), meaning ' pleasure ' . [ 3 ] Its earliest known use in the English language is from the 1850s. [ 4 ]\n",
      "Psychological or motivational hedonism is the view that all human actions aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain . It is an empirical view about what motivates people, both on the conscious and the unconscious levels. [ 6 ] Psychological hedonism is usually understood as a form of egoism , meaning that people strive to increase their own happiness. This implies that a person is only motivated to help others if it is in their own interest because they expect a personal benefit from it. [ 7 ] As a theory of human motivation, psychological hedonism does not imply that all behavior leads to pleasure. For example, if a person holds mistaken beliefs or lacks necessary skills, they may attempt to produce pleasure but fail to attain the intended outcome. [ 8 ]\n",
      "The standard form of psychological hedonism asserts that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain are the only sources of all motivation. Some psychological hedonists propose weaker formulations, suggesting that considerations of pleasure and pain influence most actions to some extent or limiting their role to certain conditions. [ 9 ] For example, reflective or rationalizing hedonism says that human motivation is only driven by pleasure and pain when people actively reflect on the overall consequences. [ 10 ] Another version is genetic hedonism, which accepts that people desire various things besides pleasure but asserts that each desire has its origin in a desire for pleasure. [ 11 ]\n",
      "Proponents of psychological hedonism often highlight its intuitive appeal and explanatory power, arguing that many desires directly focus on pleasure while the others have an indirect focus by aiming at the means to bring about pleasure. [ 12 ] Critics of psychological hedonism often cite apparent counterexamples in which people act for reasons other than their personal pleasure. Proposed examples include acts of genuine altruism , such as a soldier sacrificing themselves on the battlefield to save their comrades or a parent wanting their children to be happy. Critics also mention non-altruistic cases, like a desire for posthumous fame . It is an open question to what extent these cases can be explained as types of pleasure-seeking behavior. [ 13 ]\n",
      "Axiological or evaluative hedonism is the view that pleasure is the sole source of intrinsic value . An entity has intrinsic value or is good in itself if its worth does not depend on external factors. Intrinsic value contrasts with instrumental value , which is the value of things that lead to other good things. According to axiological hedonism, pleasure is intrinsically valuable because it is good even when it produces no external benefit. Money, by contrast, is only instrumentally good because it can be used to obtain other good things but lacks value apart from these uses. Axiological hedonism asserts that only pleasure has intrinsic value whereas other things only have instrumental value to the extent that they lead to pleasure or the avoidance of pain. [ 14 ] The overall value of a thing depends on both its intrinsic and instrumental value. In some cases, even unpleasant things, like a painful surgery, can be overall good, according to axiological hedonism, if their positive consequences make up for the unpleasantness. [ 15 ]\n",
      "Prudential hedonism is a form of axiological hedonism that focuses specifically well-being or what is good for an individual. It states that pleasure and pain are the sole factors of well-being, meaning that how good a life is for a person only depends on its balance of pleasure over pain. Prudential hedonism allows for the possibility that other things than well-being have intrinsic value, such as beauty or freedom. [ 16 ]\n",
      "According to quantitative hedonism, the intrinsic value of pleasure depends solely on its intensity and duration. Qualitative hedonists hold that the quality of pleasure is an additional factor. They argue, for instance, that subtle pleasures of the mind, like the enjoyment of fine art and philosophy, can be more valuable than simple bodily pleasures, like enjoying food and drink, even if their intensity is lower. [ 17 ]\n",
      "Proponents of axiological hedonism often focus on intuitions about the relation between pleasure and value or on the observation that pleasure is desirable. [ 15 ] The idea that most pleasures are valuable in some form is relatively uncontroversial. However, the stronger claim that all pleasures are valuable and that they are the only source of intrinsic value is subject to debate. [ 19 ] Some critics assert that certain pleasures are worthless or even bad, like disgraceful and sadistic pleasures. [ 20 ] [ a ] A different criticism comes from value pluralists , who contend that other things besides pleasure have value. To support the idea that beauty is an additional source of value, G. E. Moore used a thought experiment involving two worlds: one exceedingly beautiful and the other a heap of filth. He argued that the beautiful world is better even if there is no one to enjoy it. [ 22 ] Another influential thought experiment, proposed by Robert Nozick , involves an experience machine able to create artificial pleasures. Based on his observation that most people would not want to spend the rest of their lives in this type of pleasant illusion, he argued that hedonism cannot account for the values of authenticity and genuine experience. [ 18 ] [ b ]\n",
      "Ethical or normative hedonism is the thesis that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain are the highest moral principles of human behavior. [ c ] It implies that other moral considerations, like duty , justice , or virtue , are relevant only to the extent that they influence pleasure and pain. [ 26 ]\n",
      "Theories of ethical hedonism can be divided into egoistic and utilitarian theories. Egoistic hedonism says that each person should only pursue their own pleasure. According to this controversial view, a person only has a moral reason to care about the happiness of others if this happiness impacts their own well-being. For example, if a person feels guilty about harming others, they have a reason not to do so. However, a person would be free to harm others, and would even be morally required to, if they overall benefit from it. [ 27 ]\n",
      "Utilitarian hedonism, also called classical utilitarianism , asserts that everyone's happiness matters. It says that a person should maximize the sum total of happiness of everybody affected by their actions. This sum total includes the person's own happiness, but it is only one factor among many without any special preference compared to the happiness of others. [ 28 ] As a result, utilitarian hedonism sometimes requires of people to forego their own enjoyment to benefit others. For example, philosopher Peter Singer argues that good earners should donate a significant portion of their income to charities since this money can produce more happiness for people in need. [ 29 ]\n",
      "Ethical hedonism is often understood as a form of consequentialism , which asserts that an act is right if it has the best consequences. It is typically combined with axiological hedonism, which links the intrinsic value of consequences to pleasure and pain. As a result, the arguments for and against axiological hedonism also apply to ethical hedonism. [ 30 ]\n",
      "Aesthetic hedonism is a theory about the nature of aesthetic value or beauty. It states that a thing, like a landscape, a painting, or a song, has aesthetic value if people are pleased by it or get aesthetic pleasure from it. It is a subjective theory because it focuses on how people respond to aesthetically engaging things. It contrasts with objective theories, which assert that aesthetic value only depends on objective or mind-independent features of things, like symmetry or harmonic composition. Some aesthetic hedonists believe that any type of pleasure is relevant to the aesthetic value of a thing. Others offer a more nuanced characterization, saying that aesthetic value is only based on how people with a well-developed taste respond to it. [ 31 ]\n",
      "Outside the academic contexts of philosophy and psychology, the word hedonism is often used in a more narrow sense as a pejorative term. Sometimes called folk hedonism , it describes a lifestyle dedicated to the egoistic pursuit of short-term gratification. For example, a person who indulges in sex and drugs without concern for the long-term consequences of their behavior is acting hedonistically in this sense. The negative connotation of the term is associated with a lack of interest or foresight regarding the potential harm or ethical implications of such actions. Negative consequences can impact both the individual and the people around them, affecting areas such as health, financial stability, relationships, and societal responsibilities. Most philosophical hedonists reject the idea that a lifestyle characterized by folk hedonism leads to long-term happiness. [ 32 ]\n",
      "Pleasure and pain are fundamental experiences about what is attractive and aversive, influencing how people feel, think, and act. [ 33 ] They play a central role in all forms of hedonism. [ 34 ] Both pleasure and pain come in degrees corresponding to their intensity. They are typically understood as a continuum ranging from positive degrees through a neutral point to negative degrees. [ 35 ] However, some hedonists reject the idea that pleasure and pain form a symmetric pair and suggest instead that avoiding pain is more important than producing pleasure. [ 36 ]\n",
      "The nature of pleasure and pain is disputed and affects the plausibility of various versions of hedonism. In everyday language, these concepts are often understood in a narrow sense associated with specific phenomena, like the pleasure of food and sex or the pain of an injury. [ 37 ] However, hedonists usually take a wider perspective in which pleasure and pain cover any positive or negative experiences. In this broad sense, anything that feels good is a pleasure, including the joy of watching a sunset, whereas anything that feels bad is a pain, including the sorrow of losing a loved one. [ 38 ] A traditionally influential position says that pleasure and pain are specific bodily sensations, similar to the sensations of hot and cold. A more common view in contemporary philosophy holds that pleasure and pain are attitudes of attraction or aversion toward objects. This view implies that they do not have a specific location in the body and do not arise in isolation since they are always directed at an object that people enjoy or suffer. [ 39 ]\n",
      "Both philosophers and psychologists are interested in methods of measuring pleasure and pain to guide decision-making and gain a deeper understanding of their causes. A common approach is to use self-report questionnaires in which people are asked to quantify how pleasant or unpleasant an experience is. For example, some questionnaires use a nine-point scale from -4 for the most unpleasant experiences, to +4 for the most pleasant ones. Some methods rely on memory and ask individuals to retrospectively assess their experiences. A different approach is for individuals to evaluate their experiences while they are happening to avoid biases and inaccuracies introduced by memory. [ 40 ]\n",
      "In either form, the measurement of pleasure and pain poses various challenges. As a highly subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to establish a standardized metric. Moreover, asking people to rate their experiences using an artificially constructed scale may not accurately reflect their subjective experiences. A closely related problem concerns comparisons between individuals since different people may use the scales differently and thus arrive at different values even if they had similar experiences. [ 40 ] Neuroscientists avoid some of these challenges by using neuroimaging techniques such as PET scans and fMRI . However, this approach comes with new difficulties of its own since the neurological basis of happiness is not yet fully understood. [ 41 ]\n",
      "Based on the idea that individual experiences of pleasure and pain can be quantified, Jeremy Bentham proposed the hedonistic calculus as a method to combine various episodes to arrive at their total contribution to happiness. This makes it possible to quantitatively compare different courses of action based on the experiences they produce to choose the course with the highest overall contribution to happiness. Bentham considered several factors for each pleasurable experience: its intensity and duration, the likelihood that it occurs, its temporal distance, the likelihood that it causes further experiences of pleasure and pain, and the number of people affected. Some simplified versions of the hedonic calculus focus primarily on what is intrinsically valuable to a person and only consider two factors: intensity and duration. [ 42 ]\n",
      "Some theorists formulate hedonism in terms of happiness rather than pleasure and pain. According to a common interpretation, happiness is the balance of pleasure over pain. This means that a person is happy if they have more pleasure than pain and unhappy if the balance is overall negative. [ 43 ] There are also other ways to understand happiness that do not fully align with the traditional account of hedonism. One view defines happiness as life satisfaction. This means that a person is happy if they have a favorable attitude toward their life, for example, by being satisfied with their life as a whole or by judging it to be good overall. This attitude may be affected by the balance of pleasure over pain but can also be shaped by other factors. [ 44 ]\n",
      "Well-being is what is ultimately good for a person. [ 45 ] According to a common view, pleasure is one component of well-being. It is controversial whether it is the only factor and what other factors there are, such as health, knowledge, and friendship. Another approach focuses on desires, saying that well-being consists in the satisfaction of desires. [ 46 ] The view that the balance of pleasure over pain is the only source of well-being is called prudential hedonism . [ 47 ]\n",
      "Eudaimonia is a form of well-being rooted in ancient Greek thought , serving as a foundation of many forms of hedonism during this period. Aristotle understood eudaimonia as a type of flourishing in which a person is happy by leading a fulfilling life and manifesting their inborn capacities. Ethical theories based on eudaimonia are typically not pure versions of hedonism since they combine an interest in long-term happiness with a form of virtue ethics advocating an active lifestyle focused on self-realization . [ 48 ]\n",
      "The paradox of hedonism is the thesis that the direct pursuit of pleasure is counterproductive. It says that conscious attempts to become happy usually backfire, acting as obstacles to one's personal happiness. According to one interpretation, the best way to produce pleasure is to follow other endeavors, with pleasure being a by-product rather than the goal itself. For example, this view suggests that a tennis player who tries to win a game may enjoy the activity more than a tennis player who tries to maximize their enjoyment. It is controversial to what extent the paradox of hedonism is true since, at least in some cases, the pursuit of pleasure is successful. [ 49 ]\n",
      "A related phenomenon, the hedonic treadmill is the theory that people return to a stable level of happiness after significant positive or negative changes to their life circumstances. This suggests that good or bad events affect a person's happiness temporarily but not in the long term—their overall level of happiness tends to revert to a baseline as they get used to the changed situation. For instance, studies on lottery winners indicate that their happiness initially increases as the newly acquired wealth augments their living standards but returns to its original level after about one year. If true, this effect would undermine efforts to increase happiness in the long term, including personal efforts to lead a healthy lifestyle and social efforts to create a free, just, and prosperous society. While there is some empirical support for this effect, it is controversial how strong this tendency is and whether it applies to all fields or only to certain aspects of life. [ 50 ]\n",
      "Non-hedonist theories reject certain aspects of hedonism. One form of non-hedonism says that pleasure is one thing in life that matters but not the only thing. Another form argues that some pleasures are good while others are bad. The strongest rejection of hedonism, sometimes termed anti-hedonism , claims that all pleasures are bad. Motivations to adopt this view include the idea that pleasure is an irrational emotion and that the pursuit of pleasure is an obstacle that prevents people from leading a good life. [ 51 ]\n",
      "Asceticism is a lifestyle dedicated to a program of self-discipline that renounces worldly pleasures. It can take various forms, including abstinence from sex and drugs, fasting , withdrawal from society, and practices like prayer and meditation . This lifestyle is often motivated by religious aspirations to become close to the divine, reach a heightened spiritual state, or purify oneself. [ 52 ] Most forms of asceticism are opposed to hedonism and its pursuit of pleasure. However, there are forms of ascetic hedonism that combine the two views, for example, by asserting that the right form of ascetic practice leads to higher overall happiness by replacing simple sensory pleasures with deeper and more meaningful spiritual pleasures. [ 53 ]\n",
      "Hedonism is one of the oldest philosophical theories and some interpreters trace it back to the Epic of Gilgamesh , written around 2100–2000 BCE. [ 54 ] A central topic in ancient Greek thought , Aristippus of Cyrene (435-356 BCE) is usually identified as its earliest philosophical proponent. As a student of Socrates ( c. 469–399 BCE ), [ 55 ] he formulated a hedonistic egoism, arguing that personal pleasure is the highest good. He and the school of Cyrenaics he inspired focused on the gratification of immediate sensory pleasures with little concern for long-term consequences. [ 56 ] Plato ( c. 428–347 BCE ) [ 57 ] critiqued this view and proposed a more balanced pursuit of pleasure that aligns with virtue and rationality. [ 58 ] Following a similar approach, Aristotle (384–322 BCE) [ 59 ] associated pleasure with eudaimonia or the realization of natural human capacities, like reason. [ 60 ]\n",
      "Epicurus (341–271 BCE) developed a nuanced form of hedonism that contrasts with the indulgence in immediate gratification proposed by the Cyrenaics. He argued that excessive desires and anxiety result in suffering, suggesting instead that people practice moderation, cultivate a tranquil state of mind , and avoid pain. [ 24 ] Following Antisthenes ( c. 446—366 BCE ), the Cynics warned against the pursuit of pleasure, viewing it as an obstacle to freedom. [ 61 ] The Stoics also dismissed a hedonistic lifestyle, focusing on virtue and integrity instead of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. [ 62 ] Lucretius ( c. 99–55 BCE ) further expanded on Epicureanism, highlighting the importance of overcoming obstacles to personal happiness, such as the fear of death. [ 63 ]\n",
      "In ancient India , the Charvaka school developed a hedonistic egoism, starting between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. Their belief in the non-existence of God or an afterlife led them to advocate for enjoying life in the present to the fullest. Many other Indian traditions rejected this view and recommended a more ascetic lifestyle, a tendency common among Hindu , Buddhist , and Jain schools of thought. [ 64 ] In ancient China, Yang Zhu ( c. 440–360 BCE ) [ d ] argued that it is human nature to follow self-interest and satisfy personal desires. His hedonistic egoism inspired the subsequent school of Yangism . [ 66 ]\n",
      "Hedonist philosophy received less attention in medieval philosophy . [ 67 ] The early Christian philosopher Augustine of Hippo (354–430 CE), [ 68 ] was critical of the hedonism found in ancient Greek philosophy, warning of the dangers of earthly pleasures as obstacles to a spiritual life dedicated to God. [ 69 ] Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274 CE) developed a nuanced perspective on hedonism, characterized by some interpreters as spiritual hedonism. He held that humans are naturally inclined to seek happiness, arguing that the only way to truly satisfy this inclination is through a beatific vision of God. [ 70 ] In Islamic philosophy , al-Razi ( c. 864—925 or 932 CE ) was influenced by Epicureanism and defended a subtle form of hedonism, emphasizing moderation and the avoidance of excess. [ 71 ] Both al-Farabi ( c. 878–950 CE ) [ 72 ] and Avicenna (980–1037 CE) [ 73 ] asserted that a form of intellectual happiness, reachable only in the afterlife, is the highest human good. [ 74 ]\n",
      "At the transition to the early modern period, Lorenzo Valla ( c. 1406–1457 ) synthesized Epicurean hedonism with Christian ethics , suggesting that earthly pleasures associated with the senses are stepping stones to heavenly pleasures associated with Christian virtues. [ 75 ] Hedonism gained prominence during the Age of Enlightenment . [ 76 ] According to Thomas Hobbes 's (1588–1679) [ 77 ] psychological hedonism, self-interest in what is pleasant is the root of all human motivation. [ 5 ] John Locke (1632-1704) stated that pleasure and pain are the only sources of good and evil. [ 78 ] Joseph Butler (1692–1752) formulated an objection to psychological hedonism, arguing that most desires, like wanting food or ambition, are not directed at pleasure itself but at external objects. [ 79 ] According to David Hume (1711–1776), [ 80 ] pleasure and pain are both the measure of ethical value and the main motivators fueling the passions. [ 81 ] The libertine novels of Marquis de Sade (1740–1814) depicted an extreme form of hedonism, emphasizing full indulgence in pleasurable activities without moral or sexual restraint . [ 82 ]\n",
      "Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) [ 83 ] developed an influential form of hedonism known as classical utilitarianism . One of his key innovations was the rejection of egoistic hedonism, advocating instead that individuals should promote the greatest good for the greatest number of people. He introduced the idea of the hedonic calculus to assess the value of an action based on the pleasurable and painful experiences it causes, relying on factors such as intensity and duration. [ 84 ] His student John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) [ 85 ] feared that Bentham's quantitative focus on intensity and duration would lead to an overemphasis on simple sensory pleasures. In response, he included the quality of pleasures as an additional factor, arguing that higher pleasures of the mind are more valuable than lower pleasures of the body. [ 86 ] Henry Sidgwick (1838–1900) further refined utilitarianism and clarified many of its core distinctions, such as the contrast between ethical and psychological hedonism and between egoistic and impartial hedonism. [ 87 ]\n",
      "Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) [ 88 ] rejected ethical hedonism and emphasized the importance of excellence and self-overcoming instead, stating that suffering is necessary to achieve greatness rather than something to be avoided. [ 89 ] An influential view about the nature of pleasure was developed by Franz Brentano (1838–1917). [ 90 ] He dismissed the idea that pleasure is a sensation located in a specific area of the body, proposing instead that pleasure is a positive attitude that people can have towards various objects [ e ] —a position also later defended by Roderick Chisholm (1916–1999). [ 92 ] Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) developed a form of psychological hedonism in his early psychoanalytic theory . He stated that the pleasure principle describes how individuals seek immediate pleasure while avoiding pain whereas the reality principle represents the ability to postpone immediate gratification to avoid unpleasant long-term consequences. [ 93 ]\n",
      "The 20th century saw various criticisms of hedonism. [ 94 ] G. E. Moore (1873–1958) [ 95 ] rejected the hedonistic idea that pleasure is the only source of intrinsic value. According to his axiological pluralism , there are other sources, such as beauty and knowledge , [ 96 ] a criticism also shared by W. D. Ross (1877–1971). [ 97 ] Both C. D. Broad (1887–1971) and Richard Brandt (1910–1997) held that malicious pleasures, like enjoying the suffering of others, do not have inherent value. [ 98 ] Robert Nozick (1938–2002) used his experience machine thought experiment about simulated pleasure to argue against traditional hedonism, which ignores whether there is an authentic connection between pleasure and reality. [ 18 ]\n",
      "In response to these and similar criticisms, Fred Feldman (1941–present) has developed a modified form of hedonism. Drawing on Brentano's attitudinal theory of pleasure, he has defended the idea that even though pleasure is the only source of intrinsic goodness, its value must be adjusted based on whether it is appropriate or deserved. [ 99 ] Peter Singer (1946–present) has expanded classical hedonism to include concerns about animal welfare . [ f ] He has advocated effective altruism , relying on empirical evidence and reason to prioritize actions that have the most significant positive impact. [ 101 ] Inspired by the philosophy of Albert Camus (1913–1960), Michel Onfray (1959–present) has aimed to rehabilitate Epicurean hedonism in a modern form. [ 102 ] David Pearce (1959–present) has developed a transhumanist version of hedonism, arguing for the use of modern technology, ranging from genetic engineering to nanotechnology , to reduce suffering and possibly eliminate it in the future. [ 103 ] The emergence of positive psychology at the turn of the 21st century has led to an increased interest in the empirical exploration of various topics of hedonism. [ 104 ]\n",
      "Positive psychology studies how to cultivate happiness and promote optimal human functioning. Unlike traditional psychology , which often focuses on psychopathology , positive psychology emphasizes that optimal functioning goes beyond merely the absence of mental illness . On the individual level, it investigates experiences of pleasure and pain and the role of character traits . On the societal level, it examines how social institutions impact human well-being. [ 105 ]\n",
      "Hedonic psychology or hedonics [ g ] is one of the main pillars of positive psychology by studying pleasurable and unpleasurable experiences. It investigates and compares different states of consciousness associated with pleasure and pain, ranging from joy and satisfaction to boredom and sorrow. It also examines the role or biological function of these states, such as signaling to individuals what to approach and avoid, and their purpose as reward and punishment to reinforce or discourage future behavioral patterns. Additionally, hedonic psychology explores the circumstances that evoke these experiences, on both the biological and social levels. [ 107 ] It includes questions about psychological obstacles to pleasure, such as anhedonia , which is a reduced ability to experience pleasure, and hedonophobia , which is a fear or aversion to pleasure. [ 108 ] Positive psychology in general and hedonic psychology in particular are relevant to hedonism by providing a scientific understanding of the experiences of pleasure and pain and the processes impacting them. [ 109 ]\n",
      "In the field of economics , welfare economics examines how economic activities affect social welfare . It is often understood as a form of normative economics that uses considerations of welfare to evaluate economic processes and policies. Hedonist approaches to welfare economics state that pleasure is the main criterion of this evaluation, meaning that economic activities should aim to promote societal happiness. [ 110 ] The economics of happiness is a closely related field studying the relation between economic phenomena, such as wealth, and individual happiness. [ 111 ] Economists also employ hedonic regression , a method used to estimate the value of commodities based on their utility or effect on the owner's pleasure. [ 112 ]\n",
      "Animal ethics is the branch of ethics studying human behavior towards other animals. Hedonism is an influential position in this field as a theory about animal welfare . It emphasizes that humans have the responsibility to consider the impact of their actions on how animals feel to minimize harm done to them. [ 114 ] Some quantitative hedonists suggest that there is no significant difference between the pleasure and pain experienced by humans and other animals. As a result of this view, moral considerations about promoting the happiness of other people apply equally to all sentient animals. This position is modified by some qualitative hedonists, who argue that human experiences carry more weight because they include higher forms of pleasure and pain. [ 115 ]\n",
      "While many religious traditions are critical of hedonism, some have embraced it or certain aspects of it, such as Christian hedonism . [ 116 ] Elements of hedonism are also found in various forms of popular culture , such as consumerism , the entertainment industry , and the enduring influences of the sexual revolution . [ 117 ]\n"

      "In philosophy , nihilism ( / ˈ n aɪ ( h ) ɪ l ɪ z əm , ˈ n iː -/ ; from Latin nihil 'nothing') is any viewpoint, or a family of views, that rejects generally accepted or fundamental aspects of human existence, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] namely knowledge , morality , or meaning . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] There have been different nihilist positions, including that human values are baseless, that life is meaningless, that knowledge is impossible, or that some other highly regarded concepts are in fact meaningless or pointless. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The term was popularized by Ivan Turgenev and more specifically by his character Bazarov in the novel Fathers and Sons .\n",
      "Scholars of nihilism may regard it as merely a label that has been applied to various separate philosophies, [ 7 ] or as a distinct historical concept arising out of nominalism , skepticism , and philosophical pessimism , as well as possibly out of Christianity itself. [ 8 ] Contemporary understanding of the idea stems largely from the Nietzschean 'crisis of nihilism', from which derive the two central concepts: the destruction of higher values and the opposition to the affirmation of life . [ 9 ] [ 5 ] Definitions by philosophers such as Crosby (1998) and Deleuze (1962) focus on extreme critiques of nihilism like those asserted by Nietzsche. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Earlier forms of nihilism, however, may be more selective in negating specific hegemonies of social, moral, political and aesthetic thought. [ 12 ]\n",
      "The term is sometimes used in association with anomie to explain the general mood of despair at a perceived pointlessness of existence or arbitrariness of human principles and social institutions . Nihilism has also been described as conspicuous in or constitutive of certain historical periods . For example, [ 13 ] Jean Baudrillard [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and others have characterized postmodernity as a nihilistic epoch [ 16 ] or mode of thought. [ 17 ] Likewise, some theologians and religious figures have stated that postmodernity [ 18 ] and many aspects of modernity [ 19 ] represent nihilism by a negation of religious principles. Nihilism has, however, been widely ascribed to both religious and irreligious viewpoints. [ 8 ]\n",
      "In popular use, the term commonly refers to forms of existential nihilism , according to which life is without intrinsic value , meaning , or purpose. [ 20 ] Other prominent positions within nihilism include the rejection of all normative and ethical views ( § Moral nihilism ), the rejection of all social and political institutions ( § Political nihilism ), the stance that no knowledge can or does exist ( § Epistemological nihilism ), and a number of metaphysical positions, which assert that non-abstract objects do not exist ( § Metaphysical nihilism ), that composite objects do not exist ( § Mereological nihilism ), or even that life itself does not exist.\n",
      "The etymological origin of nihilism is the Latin root word nihil , meaning 'nothing', which is similarly found in the related terms annihilate , meaning 'to bring to nothing', [ 5 ] and nihility , meaning ' nothingness '. [ 21 ] The term nihilism emerged in several places in Europe during the 18th century, [ 7 ] notably in the German form Nihilismus , [ 22 ] though was also in use during the Middle Ages to denote certain forms of heresy . [ 23 ] The concept itself first took shape within Russian and German philosophy , which respectively represented the two major currents of discourse on nihilism prior to the 20th century. [ 22 ] The term likely entered English from either the German Nihilismus , Late Latin nihilismus , or French nihilisme . [ 24 ]\n",
      "Early examples of the term's use are found in German publications. In 1733, German writer Friedrich Leberecht Goetz used it as a literary term in combination with noism ( German : Neinismus ). [ 25 ] In the period surrounding the French Revolution , the term was also a pejorative for certain value-destructive trends of modernity , namely the negation of Christianity and European tradition in general. [ 7 ] Nihilism first entered philosophical study within a discourse surrounding Kantian and post-Kantian philosophies, notably appearing in the writings of Swiss esotericist Jacob Hermann Obereit in 1787 and German philosopher Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi in 1799. [ 26 ] As early as 1824, the term began to take on a social connotation with German journalist Joseph von Görres attributing it to a negation of existing social and political institutions. [ 27 ] The Russian form of the word, nigilizm ( Russian : нигилизм ), entered publication in 1829 when Nikolai Nadezhdin used it synonymously with skepticism . In Russian journalism the word continued to have significant social connotations. [ 28 ]\n",
      "From the time of Jacobi, the term almost fell completely out of use throughout Europe until it was revived by Russian author Ivan Turgenev , who brought the word into popular use with his 1862 novel Fathers and Sons , leading many scholars to believe he coined the term. [ 29 ] The nihilist characters of the novel define themselves as those who \"deny everything \", who do \"not take any principle on faith, whatever reverence that principle may be enshrined in\", and who regard \"at the present time, negation is the most useful of all\". [ 30 ] Despite Turgenev's own anti-nihilistic leanings, many of his readers likewise took up the name of nihilist , thus ascribing the Russian nihilist movement its name. [ 31 ] Nihilism was further discussed by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , who used the term to describe the Western world 's disintegration of traditional morality. [ 32 ] For Nietzsche, nihilism applied to both the modern trends of value-destruction expressed in the ' death of God ', as well as what he saw as the life-denying morality of Christianity . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Under Nietzsche's profound influence, the term was then further treated within French philosophy and continental philosophy more broadly, while the influence of nihilism in Russia arguably continued well into the Soviet era .

      "Religious scholars such as Altizer have stated that nihilism must necessarily be understood in relation to religion, and that the study of core elements of its character requires fundamentally theological consideration. [ 36 ]\n",
      "The concept of nihilism was discussed by the Buddha (563 BC to 483 BC), as recorded in the Theravada and Mahayana Tripiṭaka . [ 37 ] The Tripiṭaka , originally written in Pali , refers to nihilism as natthikavāda and the nihilist view as micchādiṭṭhi . [ 38 ] Various sutras within it describe a multiplicity of views held by different sects of ascetics while the Buddha was alive, some of which were viewed by him to be morally nihilistic. In the \"Doctrine of Nihilism\" in the Apannaka Sutta , the Buddha describes moral nihilists as holding the following views: [ 39 ]\n",
      "The Buddha further states that those who hold these views will fail to see the virtue in good mental, verbal, and bodily conduct and the corresponding dangers in misconduct, and will therefore tend towards the latter. [ 39 ]\n",
      "The culmination of the path that the Buddha taught was nirvana , \"a place of nothingness ... nonpossession and... non-attachment ...[which is] the total end of death and decay.\" [ 40 ] Ajahn Amaro , an ordained Buddhist monk of more than 40 years, observes that in English nothingness can sound like nihilism. However, the word could be emphasized in a different way, so that it becomes no-thingness , indicating that nirvana is not a thing you can find, but rather a state where you experience the reality of non-grasping. [ 40 ]\n",
      "In the Alagaddupama Sutta , the Buddha describes how some individuals feared his teaching because they believe that their self would be destroyed if they followed it. He describes this as an anxiety caused by the false belief in an unchanging, everlasting self . All things are subject to change and taking any impermanent phenomena to be a self causes suffering. Nonetheless, his critics called him a nihilist who teaches the annihilation and extermination of an existing being. The Buddha's response was that he only teaches the cessation of suffering. When an individual has given up craving and the conceit of 'I am' their mind is liberated, they no longer come into any state of ' being ' and are no longer born again. [ 41 ]\n",
      "The Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta records a conversation between the Buddha and an individual named Vaccha that further elaborates on this. In the sutta, Vaccha asks the Buddha to confirm one of the following, with respect to the existence of the Buddha after death: [ 42 ]\n",
      "To all four questions, the Buddha answers that the terms \"reappears somewhere else,\" \"does not reappear,\" \"both does and does not reappear,\" and \"neither does nor does not reappear,\" do not apply. When Vaccha expresses puzzlement, the Buddha asks Vaccha a counter question to the effect of: if a fire were to go out and someone were to ask you whether the fire went north, south, east or west, how would you reply? Vaccha replies that the question does not apply and that an extinguished fire can only be classified as 'out'. [ 42 ]\n",
      "Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu elaborates on the classification problem around the words 'reappear,' etc. with respect to the Buddha and Nirvana by stating that a \"Person who has attained the goal [nirvana] is thus indescribable because [they have] abandoned all things by which [they] could be described.\" [ 43 ] The Suttas themselves describe the liberated mind as 'untraceable' or as 'consciousness without feature', making no distinction between the mind of a liberated being that is alive and the mind of one that is no longer alive. [ 41 ] [ 44 ]\n",
      "Despite the Buddha's explanations to the contrary, Buddhist practitioners may, at times, still approach Buddhism in a nihilistic manner. Ajahn Amaro illustrates this by retelling the story of a Buddhist monk, Ajahn Sumedho , who in his early years took a nihilistic approach to Nirvana. A distinct feature of Nirvana in Buddhism is that an individual attaining it is no longer subject to rebirth. Ajahn Sumedho, during a conversation with his teacher Ajahn Chah , comments that he is \"Determined above all things to fully realize Nirvana in this lifetime...deeply weary of the human condition and...[is] determined not to be born again.\" To this, Ajahn Chah replies: \"What about the rest of us, Sumedho? Don't you care about those who'll be left behind?\" Ajahn Amaro comments that Ajahn Chah could detect that his student had a nihilistic aversion to life rather than true detachment. [ 45 ]\n",
      "The term nihilism was first introduced to philosophy by Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi (1743–1819), who used the term to characterize rationalism , [ 46 ] and in particular Spinoza's determinism and the Aufklärung , in order to carry out a reductio ad absurdum according to which all rationalism (philosophy as criticism) reduces to nihilism—and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of faith and revelation . Bret W. Davis writes, for example: [ 47 ]\n",
      "The first philosophical development of the idea of nihilism is generally ascribed to Friedrich Jacobi, who in a famous letter criticized Fichte 's idealism as falling into nihilism. According to Jacobi, Fichte's absolutization of the ego (the 'absolute I' that posits the 'not-I') is an inflation of subjectivity that denies the absolute transcendence of God.\n",
      "A related but oppositional concept is fideism , which sees reason as hostile and inferior to faith.\n",
      "Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) posited an early form of nihilism, which he referred to as leveling . [ 48 ] He saw leveling as the process of suppressing individuality to a point where an individual's uniqueness becomes non-existent and nothing meaningful in one's existence can be affirmed:\n",
      "Levelling at its maximum is like the stillness of death, where one can hear one's own heartbeat, a stillness like death, into which nothing can penetrate, in which everything sinks, powerless. One person can head a rebellion, but one person cannot head this levelling process, for that would make him a leader and he would avoid being levelled. Each individual can in his little circle participate in this levelling, but it is an abstract process, and levelling is abstraction conquering individuality.\n",
      "Kierkegaard, an advocate of a philosophy of life , generally argued against levelling and its nihilistic consequences, although he believed it would be \"genuinely educative to live in the age of levelling [because] people will be forced to face the judgement of [levelling] alone.\" [ 49 ] George Cotkin asserts Kierkegaard was against \"the standardization and levelling of belief, both spiritual and political, in the nineteenth century,\" and that Kierkegaard \"opposed tendencies in mass culture to reduce the individual to a cipher of conformity and deference to the dominant opinion.\" [ 50 ] In his day, tabloids (like the Danish magazine Corsaren ) and apostate Christianity were instruments of levelling and contributed to the \"reflective apathetic age\" of 19th-century Europe. [ 51 ] Kierkegaard argues that individuals who can overcome the levelling process are stronger for it, and that it represents a step in the right direction towards \"becoming a true self.\" [ 49 ] [ 52 ] As we must overcome levelling, [ 53 ] Hubert Dreyfus and Jane Rubin argue that Kierkegaard's interest, \"in an increasingly nihilistic age, is in how we can recover the sense that our lives are meaningful.\" [ 54 ]\n",
      "From the period 1860–1917, Russian nihilism was both a nascent form of nihilist philosophy and broad cultural movement which overlapped with certain revolutionary tendencies of the era, [ 55 ] for which it was often wrongly characterized as a form of political terrorism . [ 56 ] Russian nihilism centered on the dissolution of existing values and ideals, incorporating theories of hard determinism , atheism , materialism , positivism , and rational egoism , while rejecting metaphysics , sentimentalism , and aestheticism . [ 57 ] Leading philosophers of this school of thought included Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Dmitry Pisarev . [ 58 ]\n",
      "The intellectual origins of the Russian nihilist movement can be traced back to 1855 and perhaps earlier, [ 59 ] where it was principally a philosophy of extreme moral and epistemological skepticism . [ 60 ] However, it was not until 1862 that the name nihilism was first popularized, when Ivan Turgenev used the term in his celebrated novel Fathers and Sons to describe the disillusionment of the younger generation towards both the progressives and traditionalists that came before them, [ 61 ] as well as its manifestation in the view that negation and value-destruction were most necessary to the present conditions. [ 62 ] The movement very soon adopted the name, despite the novel's initial harsh reception among both the conservatives and younger generation. [ 63 ]\n",
      "Though philosophically both nihilistic and skeptical, Russian nihilism did not unilaterally negate ethics and knowledge as may be assumed, nor did it espouse meaninglessness unequivocally. [ 64 ] Even so, contemporary scholarship has challenged the equating of Russian nihilism with mere skepticism, instead identifying it as a fundamentally Promethean movement. [ 65 ] As passionate advocates of negation, the nihilists sought to liberate the Promethean might of the Russian people which they saw embodied in a class of prototypal individuals, or new types in their own words. [ 66 ] These individuals, according to Pisarev, in freeing themselves from all authority become exempt from moral authority as well, and are distinguished above the rabble or common masses. [ 67 ]\n",
      "Later interpretations of nihilism were heavily influenced by works of anti-nihilistic literature , such as those of Fyodor Dostoevsky , which arose in response to Russian nihilism. [ 68 ] \"In contrast to the corrupted nihilists [of the real world], who tried to numb their nihilistic sensitivity and forget themselves through self-indulgence, Dostoevsky's figures voluntarily leap into nihilism and try to be themselves within its boundaries.\", writes contemporary scholar Nishitani . \"The nihility expressed in 'if there is no God, everything is permitted' , or ' après moi, le déluge ' , provides a principle whose sincerity they try to live out to the end. They search for and experiment with ways for the self to justify itself after God has disappeared.\" [ 69 ]\n",
      "Nihilism is often associated with the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , who provided a detailed diagnosis of nihilism as a widespread phenomenon of Western culture. Though the notion appears frequently throughout Nietzsche's work, he uses the term in a variety of ways, with different meanings and connotations.\n",
      "With regard to Nietzsche's development of thought, it has been noted in research that although he dealt with \"nihilistic\" themes from 1869 onwards (\"pessimism, with nirvana and with nothingness and non-being\" [ 70 ] ), a conceptual use of nihilism occurred for the first time in handwritten notes in the middle of 1880 ( KSA 9.127-128). This was the time of a then popular scientific work that reconstructed the so-called \"Russian nihilism\" on the basis of Russian newspaper reports on nihilistic incidents (N. Karlowitsch: Die Entwicklung des Nihilismus. Berlin 1880). This collection of material, published in three editions, was not only known to a broad German readership, but its influence on Nietzsche can also be proven. [ 71 ]\n",
      "Karen L. Carr describes Nietzsche's characterization of nihilism as \"a condition of tension, as a disproportion between what we want to value (or need) and how the world appears to operate.\" [ 33 ] : 25 When we find out that the world does not possess the objective value or meaning that we want it to have or have long since believed it to have, we find ourselves in a crisis. [ 72 ] Nietzsche asserts that with the decline of Christianity and the rise of physiological decadence , [ clarification needed ] nihilism is in fact characteristic of the modern age, [ 73 ] though he implies that the rise of nihilism is still incomplete and that it has yet to be overcome. [ 74 ] Though the problem of nihilism becomes especially explicit in Nietzsche's notebooks (published posthumously), it is mentioned repeatedly in his published works and is closely connected to many of the problems mentioned there.\n",
      "Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world and especially human existence of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, or essential value. This observation stems in part from Nietzsche's perspectivism , or his notion that \"knowledge\" is always by someone of some thing: it is always bound by perspective, and it is never mere fact. [ 75 ] Rather, there are interpretations through which we understand the world and give it meaning. Interpreting is something we can not go without; in fact, it is a condition of subjectivity. One way of interpreting the world is through morality, as one of the fundamental ways that people make sense of the world, especially in regard to their own thoughts and actions. Nietzsche distinguishes a morality that is strong or healthy, meaning that the person in question is aware that he constructs it himself, from weak morality, where the interpretation is projected on to something external.\n",
      "Nietzsche discusses Christianity, one of the major topics in his work, at length in the context of the problem of nihilism in his notebooks, in a chapter entitled \"European Nihilism.\" [ 76 ] Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with intrinsic value , belief in God (which justifies the evil in the world) and a basis for objective knowledge . In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote against a primal form of nihilism, against the despair of meaninglessness. However, it is exactly the element of truthfulness in Christian doctrine that is its undoing: in its drive towards truth, Christianity eventually finds itself to be a construct, which leads to its own dissolution. It is therefore that Nietzsche states that we have outgrown Christianity \"not because we lived too far from it, rather because we lived too close.\" [ 77 ] As such, the self-dissolution of Christianity constitutes yet another form of nihilism. Because Christianity was an interpretation that posited itself as the interpretation, Nietzsche states that this dissolution leads beyond skepticism to a distrust of all meaning. [ 78 ] [ 33 ] : 41–2\n",
      "Stanley Rosen identifies Nietzsche's concept of nihilism with a situation of meaninglessness, in which \"everything is permitted.\" According to him, the loss of higher metaphysical values that exist in contrast to the base reality of the world, or merely human ideas, gives rise to the idea that all human ideas are therefore valueless. Rejecting idealism thus results in nihilism, because only similarly transcendent ideals live up to the previous standards that the nihilist still implicitly holds. [ 79 ] The inability for Christianity to serve as a source of valuating the world is reflected in Nietzsche's famous aphorism of the madman in The Gay Science . [ 80 ] The death of God, in particular the statement that \"we killed him\", is similar to the self -dissolution of Christian doctrine: due to the advances of the sciences, which for Nietzsche show that man is the product of evolution , that Earth has no special place among the stars and that history is not progressive , the Christian notion of God can no longer serve as a basis for a morality.\n",
      "One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls passive nihilism , which he recognizes in the pessimistic philosophy of Schopenhauer . Schopenhauer's doctrine, which Nietzsche also refers to as Western Buddhism , advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterizes this attitude as a \"will to nothingness \", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This mowing away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears inconsistent: this \"will to nothingness\" is still a form of valuation or willing. [ 81 ] He describes this as \"an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists\":\n",
      "A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos – at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.\n",
      "Nietzsche's relation to the problem of nihilism is a complex one. He approaches the problem of nihilism as deeply personal, stating that this predicament of the modern world is a problem that has \"become conscious\" in him. [ 82 ] According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is overcome that a culture can have a true foundation upon which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. [ 73 ]\n",
      "He states that there is at least the possibility of another type of nihilist in the wake of Christianity's self-dissolution, one that does not stop after the destruction of all value and meaning and succumb to the following nothingness. This alternate, 'active' nihilism on the other hand destroys to level the field for constructing something new. This form of nihilism is characterized by Nietzsche as \"a sign of strength,\" [ 83 ] a willful destruction of the old values to wipe the slate clean and lay down one's own beliefs and interpretations, contrary to the passive nihilism that resigns itself with the decomposition of the old values. This willful destruction of values and the overcoming of the condition of nihilism by the constructing of new meaning, this active nihilism, could be related to what Nietzsche elsewhere calls a free spirit [ 33 ] : 43–50 or the Übermensch from Thus Spoke Zarathustra and The Antichrist , the model of the strong individual who posits his own values and lives his life as if it were his own work of art. It may be questioned, though, whether \"active nihilism\" is indeed the correct term for this stance, and some question whether Nietzsche takes the problems nihilism poses seriously enough. [ 84 ]\n",
      "Martin Heidegger 's interpretation of Nietzsche influenced many postmodern thinkers who investigated the problem of nihilism as put forward by Nietzsche. Only recently has Heidegger's influence on Nietzschean nihilism research faded. [ 85 ] As early as the 1930s, Heidegger was giving lectures on Nietzsche's thought. [ 86 ] Given the importance of Nietzsche's contribution to the topic of nihilism, Heidegger's influential interpretation of Nietzsche is important for the historical development of the term nihilism .\n",
      "Heidegger's method of researching and teaching Nietzsche is explicitly his own. He does not specifically try to present Nietzsche as Nietzsche. He rather tries to incorporate Nietzsche's thoughts into his own philosophical system of Being, Time and Dasein . [ 87 ] In his Nihilism as Determined by the History of Being (1944–46), [ 88 ] Heidegger tries to understand Nietzsche's nihilism as trying to achieve a victory through the devaluation of the, until then, highest values. The principle of this devaluation is, according to Heidegger, the will to power . The will to power is also the principle of every earlier valuation of values. [ 89 ] How does this devaluation occur and why is this nihilistic? One of Heidegger's main critiques on philosophy is that philosophy, and more specifically metaphysics , has forgotten to discriminate between investigating the notion of a being ( seiende ) and Being ( Sein ). According to Heidegger, the history of Western thought can be seen as the history of metaphysics. Moreover, because metaphysics has forgotten to ask about the notion of Being (what Heidegger calls Seinsvergessenheit ), it is a history about the destruction of Being. That is why Heidegger calls metaphysics nihilistic. [ 90 ] This makes Nietzsche's metaphysics not a victory over nihilism, but a perfection of it. [ 91 ]\n",
      "Heidegger, in his interpretation of Nietzsche, has been inspired by Ernst Jünger . Many references to Jünger can be found in Heidegger's lectures on Nietzsche. For example, in a letter to the rector of Freiburg University of November 4, 1945, Heidegger, inspired by Jünger, tries to explain the notion of \" God is dead \" as the \"reality of the Will to Power.\" Heidegger also praises Jünger for defending Nietzsche against a too biological or anthropological reading during the Nazi era . [ 92 ]\n",
      "Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche influenced a number of important postmodernist thinkers. Gianni Vattimo points at a back-and-forth movement in European thought, between Nietzsche and Heidegger. During the 1960s, a Nietzschean 'renaissance' began, culminating in the work of Mazzino Montinari and Giorgio Colli . They began work on a new and complete edition of Nietzsche's collected works, making Nietzsche more accessible for scholarly research. Vattimo explains that with this new edition of Colli and Montinari, a critical reception of Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche began to take shape. Like other contemporary French and Italian philosophers, Vattimo does not want, or only partially wants, to rely on Heidegger for understanding Nietzsche. On the other hand, Vattimo judges Heidegger's intentions authentic enough to keep pursuing them. [ 93 ] Philosophers who Vattimo exemplifies as a part of this back and forth movement are French philosophers Deleuze , Foucault and Derrida . Italian philosophers of this same movement are Cacciari , Severino and himself. [ 94 ] Jürgen Habermas , Jean-François Lyotard and Richard Rorty are also philosophers who are influenced by Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche. [ 95 ]\n",
      "Gilles Deleuze 's interpretation of Nietzsche's concept of nihilism is different—in some sense diametrically opposed—to the usual definition (as outlined in the rest of this article). Nihilism is one of the main topics of Deleuze's early book Nietzsche and Philosophy (1962). [ 96 ] There, Deleuze repeatedly interprets Nietzsche's nihilism as \"the enterprise of denying life and depreciating existence\". [ 97 ] Nihilism thus defined is therefore not the denial of higher values, or the denial of meaning, but rather the depreciation of life in the name of such higher values or meaning. Deleuze therefore (with, he claims, Nietzsche) says that Christianity and Platonism , and with them the whole of metaphysics, are intrinsically Nihilist.\n",
      "Postmodern and poststructuralist thought has questioned the very grounds on which Western cultures have based their 'truths': absolute knowledge and meaning, a 'decentralization' of authorship, the accumulation of positive knowledge, historical progress, and certain ideals and practices of humanism and the Enlightenment . [ citation needed ]\n",
      "Jacques Derrida , whose deconstruction is perhaps most commonly labeled nihilistic, did not himself make the nihilistic move that others have claimed. Derridean deconstructionists argue that this approach rather frees texts, individuals or organizations from a restrictive truth, and that deconstruction opens up the possibility of other ways of being. [ 98 ] Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak , for example, uses deconstruction to create an ethics of opening up Western scholarship to the voice of the subaltern and to philosophies outside of the canon of western texts. [ 99 ] Derrida himself built a philosophy based upon a 'responsibility to the other'. [ 100 ] Deconstruction can thus be seen not as a denial of truth, but as a denial of our ability to know truth. That is to say, it makes an epistemological claim, compared to nihilism's ontological claim.\n",
      "Lyotard argues that, rather than relying on an objective truth or method to prove their claims, philosophers legitimize their truths by reference to a story about the world that can not be separated from the age and system the stories belong to—referred to by Lyotard as meta-narratives . He then goes on to define the postmodern condition as characterized by a rejection both of these meta-narratives and of the process of legitimation by meta-narratives. This concept of the instability of truth and meaning leads in the direction of nihilism, though Lyotard stops short of embracing the latter. [ citation needed ]\n",
      "In lieu of meta-narratives we have created new language-games in order to legitimize our claims which rely on changing relationships and mutable truths, none of which is privileged over the other to speak to ultimate truth. [ citation needed ]\n",
      "Postmodern theorist Jean Baudrillard wrote briefly of nihilism from the postmodern viewpoint in Simulacra and Simulation . He stuck mainly to topics of interpretations of the real world over the simulations of which the real world is composed. The uses of meaning were an important subject in Baudrillard's discussion of nihilism:\n",
      "The apocalypse is finished, today it is the precession of the neutral, of forms of the neutral and of indifference ... all that remains, is the fascination for desertlike and indifferent forms, for the very operation of the system that annihilates us. Now, fascination (in contrast to seduction, which was attached to appearances, and to dialectical reason, which was attached to meaning) is a nihilistic passion par excellence, it is the passion proper to the mode of disappearance. We are fascinated by all forms of disappearance, of our disappearance. Melancholic and fascinated, such is our general situation in an era of involuntary transparency.\n",
      "From the 19th century, nihilism has encompassed a range of positions within various fields of philosophy. Each of these, as the Encyclopædia Britannica states, \"denied the existence of genuine moral truths or values, rejected the possibility of knowledge or communication, and asserted the ultimate meaninglessness or purposelessness of life or of the universe\". [ 101 ]\n",
      "The term Dada was first used by Richard Huelsenbeck and Tristan Tzara in 1916. [ 114 ] The movement, which lasted from approximately 1916 to 1923, arose during World War I, an event that influenced the artists. [ 115 ] The Dada Movement began in the old town of Zürich, Switzerland —known as the \"Niederdorf\" or \"Niederdörfli\"—in the Café Voltaire. [ 116 ] The Dadaists claimed that Dada was not an art movement, but an anti-art movement, sometimes using found objects in a manner similar to found poetry .\n",
      "This tendency toward devaluation of art has led many [ who? ] to claim that Dada was an essentially nihilistic movement. [ 117 ] Given that Dada created its own means for interpreting its products, it is difficult to classify alongside most other contemporary art expressions. Due to perceived ambiguity, it has been classified as a nihilistic modus vivendi . [ 115 ]\n",
      "The term \"nihilism\" was actually popularized in 1862 by Ivan Turgenev in his novel Fathers and Sons , whose hero, Bazarov, was a nihilist and recruited several followers to the philosophy. He found his nihilistic ways challenged upon falling in love. [ 118 ]\n",
      "Anton Chekhov portrayed nihilism when writing Three Sisters . The phrase \"what does it matter\" or variants of this are often spoken by several characters in response to events; the significance of some of these events suggests a subscription to nihilism by said characters as a type of coping strategy.\n",
      "The philosophical ideas of the French author, the Marquis de Sade , are often noted as early examples of nihilistic principles. [ 119 ]\n",

      "Patrick Bateman in Bret Easton Ellis 's 1991 novel American Psycho and 2000 film adaptation , displays both moral and existential nihilism. Throughout the film, Bateman does not shy away from murder or torture to accomplish his goals.

      "Existentialism is a family of philosophical views and inquiry that prioritize the existence of the human individual, study existence from the individual's perspective, and conclude that, despite the absurdity or incomprehensibility of the universe, individuals must still embrace responsibility for their actions and strive to lead authentic lives . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In examining meaning , purpose, and value , existentialist thought often includes concepts such as existential crises , angst , courage , and freedom . [ 4 ]\n",

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Among the earliest figures associated with existentialism are philosophers Søren Kierkegaard , Friedrich Nietzsche and novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky , all of whom critiqued rationalism and concerned themselves with the problem of meaning . In the 20th century, prominent existentialist thinkers included Jean-Paul Sartre , Albert Camus , Martin Heidegger , Simone de Beauvoir , Karl Jaspers , Gabriel Marcel , and Paul Tillich .\n",
      "Many existentialists considered traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in style and content, to be too abstract and removed from concrete human experience.

[ 16 ] Sartre subsequently changed his mind and, on October 29, 1945, publicly adopted the existentialist label in a lecture to the Club Maintenant in Paris , published as L'existentialisme est un humanisme ( Existentialism Is a Humanism ), a short book that helped popularize existentialist thought. [ 17 ] Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of Neo-Socratic , in honor of Kierkegaard's essay \" On the Concept of Irony \".\n",
      "Some scholars argue that the term should be used to refer only to the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s associated with the works of the philosophers Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir , Maurice Merleau-Ponty , and Albert Camus . [ 5 ] Others extend the term to Kierkegaard, and yet others extend it as far back as Socrates . [ 18 ] However, it is often identified with the philosophical views of Sartre. [ 5 ]\n",
      "The labels existentialism and existentialist are often seen as historical conveniences in as much as they were first applied to many philosophers long after they had died. While existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was Sartre. Sartre posits the idea that \"what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence \", as the philosopher Frederick Copleston explains. [ 19 ] According to philosopher Steven Crowell , defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself. [ 5 ] In a lecture delivered in 1945, Sartre described existentialism as \"the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism \". [ 20 ] For others, existentialism need not involve the rejection of God, but rather \"examines mortal man's search for meaning in a meaningless universe\", considering less \"What is the good life?\" (to feel, be, or do, good), instead asking \"What is life good for?\". [ 21 ]\n",
      "Although many outside Scandinavia consider the term existentialism to have originated from Kierkegaard, it is more likely that Kierkegaard adopted this term (or at least the term \"existential\" as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven . [ 22 ] This assertion comes from two sources:\n",
      "Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is that existence precedes essence, which is to say that individuals shape themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived and a priori categories, an \"essence\". The actual life of the individual is what constitutes what could be called their \"true essence\" instead of an arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings, through their own consciousness , create their own values and determine a meaning to their life. [ 25 ] This view is in contradiction to Aristotle and Aquinas , who taught that essence precedes individual existence. [ 26 ] Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as Heidegger, and Kierkegaard:\n",
      "The subjective thinker's form , the form of his communication, is his style . His form must be just as manifold as are the opposites that he holds together. The systematic eins, zwei, drei is an abstract form that also must inevitably run into trouble whenever it is to be applied to the concrete. To the same degree as the subjective thinker is concrete, to that same degree his form must also be concretely dialectical. But just as he himself is not a poet, not an ethicist, not a dialectician, so also his form is none of these directly. His form must first and last be related to existence, and in this regard he must have at his disposal the poetic, the ethical, the dialectical, the religious. Subordinate character, setting, etc., which belong to the well-balanced character of the esthetic production, are in themselves breadth; the subjective thinker has only one setting—existence—and has nothing to do with localities and such things. The setting is not the fairyland of the imagination, where poetry produces consummation, nor is the setting laid in England, and historical accuracy is not a concern. The setting is inwardness in existing as a human being; the concretion is the relation of the existence-categories to one another. Historical accuracy and historical actuality are breadth.\n",
      "Some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence – what Sartre would call \" bad faith \". Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are defined only insofar as they act and that they are responsible for their actions. Someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is opposed to their genes, or human nature , bearing the blame.\n",
      "As Sartre said in his lecture Existentialism is a Humanism : \"Man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards.\" The more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: a person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person. [ 27 ]\n",
      "Jonathan Webber interprets Sartre's usage of the term essence not in a modal fashion, i.e. as necessary features, but in a teleological fashion: \"an essence is the relational property of having a set of parts ordered in such a way as to collectively perform some activity\". [ 28 ] : 3 [ 5 ] For example, it belongs to the essence of a house to keep the bad weather out, which is why it has walls and a roof. Humans are different from houses because—unlike houses—they do not have an inbuilt purpose: they are free to choose their own purpose and thereby shape their essence; thus, their existence precedes their essence . [ 28 ] : 1–4\n",
      "Sartre is committed to a radical conception of freedom: nothing fixes our purpose but we ourselves, our projects have no weight or inertia except for our endorsement of them. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Simone de Beauvoir, on the other hand, holds that there are various factors, grouped together under the term sedimentation , that offer resistance to attempts to change our direction in life. Sedimentations are themselves products of past choices and can be changed by choosing differently in the present, but such changes happen slowly. They are a force of inertia that shapes the agent's evaluative outlook on the world until the transition is complete. [ 28 ] : 5, 9, 66\n",
      "Sartre's definition of existentialism was based on Heidegger's magnum opus Being and Time (1927). In the correspondence with Jean Beaufret later published as the Letter on Humanism , Heidegger implied that Sartre misunderstood him for his own purposes of subjectivism, and that he did not mean that actions take precedence over being so long as those actions were not reflected upon. [ 31 ] Heidegger commented that \"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement\", meaning that he thought Sartre had simply switched the roles traditionally attributed to essence and existence without interrogating these concepts and their history. [ 32 ]\n",
      "The notion of the absurd contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or \"unfairness\" of the world. This can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional Abrahamic religious perspective, which establishes that life's purpose is the fulfillment of God's commandments. [ 33 ] This is what gives meaning to people's lives. To live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man's existence since there is nothing to be discovered. According to Albert Camus, the world or the human being is not in itself absurd. The concept only emerges through the juxtaposition of the two; life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit. [ 33 ] This view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature. The second view, first elaborated by Søren Kierkegaard , holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings. These are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom, undermining their foundation outside of themselves. [ 34 ]\n",
      "The absurd contrasts with the claim that \"bad things don't happen to good people\"; to the world, metaphorically speaking, there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a \"good\" person as to a \"bad\" person. [ 35 ] Because of the world's absurdity, anything can happen to anyone at any time and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the absurd. Many of the literary works of Kierkegaard , Beckett , Kafka , Dostoevsky , Ionesco , Miguel de Unamuno , Luigi Pirandello , [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Sartre , Joseph Heller , and Camus contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world.\n",
      "It is because of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that Camus claimed in The Myth of Sisyphus that \"There is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.\" Although \"prescriptions\" against the possible deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard's religious \"stage\" to Camus' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers. The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of quietism , which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy. [ 40 ] It has been said that the possibility of suicide makes all humans existentialists. The ultimate hero of absurdism lives without meaning and faces suicide without succumbing to it. [ 41 ]\n",
      "Facticity is defined by Sartre in Being and Nothingness (1943) as the in-itself , which for humans takes the form of being and not being. It is the facts of one's personal life and as per Heidegger, it is \" the way in which we are thrown into the world .\" This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to the temporal dimension of our past: one's past is what one is, meaning that it is what has formed the person who exists in the present. However, to say that one is only one's past would ignore the change a person undergoes in the present and future, while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from the present self. A denial of one's concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and also applies to other kinds of facticity (having a human body—e.g., one that does not allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound—identity, values, etc.). [ 42 ]\n",
      "Facticity is a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of one's facticity consists of things one did not choose (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on it. However, even though one's facticity is \"set in stone\" (as being past, for instance), it cannot determine a person: the value ascribed to one's facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything. Both have committed many crimes, but the first man, remembering nothing, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his own past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past for \"trapping\" him in this life. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past.\n",
      "However, to disregard one's facticity during the continual process of self-making, projecting oneself into the future, would be to put oneself in denial of the conditions shaping the present self and would be inauthentic. The origin of one's projection must still be one's facticity, though in the mode of not being it (essentially). An example of one focusing solely on possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity: [ 42 ] would be someone who continually thinks about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without acknowledging the facticity of not currently having the financial means to do so . In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a future-facticity of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car.\n",
      "Another aspect of facticity is that it entails angst . Freedom \"produces\" angst when limited by facticity and the lack of the possibility of having facticity to \"step in\" and take responsibility for something one has done also produces angst.\n",
      "Another aspect of existential freedom is that one can change one's values. One is responsible for one's values, regardless of society's values. The focus on freedom in existentialism is related to the limits of responsibility one bears, as a result of one's freedom. The relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible. [ 43 ] [ 44 ]\n",
      "Many noted existentialists consider the theme of authentic existence important. Authenticity involves the idea that one has to \"create oneself\" and live in accordance with this self. For an authentic existence, one should act as oneself, not as \"one's acts\" or as \"one's genes\" or as any other essence requires. The authentic act is one in accordance with one's freedom. A component of freedom is facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity determines one's transcendent choices (one could then blame one's background for making the choice one made [chosen project, from one's transcendence]). Facticity, in relation to authenticity, involves acting on one's actual values when making a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard's Aesthete, \"choosing\" randomly), so that one takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values. [ 45 ]\n",
      "In contrast, the inauthentic is the denial to live [ clarification needed ] in accordance with one's freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, convincing oneself that some form of determinism is true, or \"mimicry\" where one acts as \"one should\". [ citation needed ]\n",
      "How one \"should\" act is often determined by an image one has, of how one in such a role (bank manager, lion tamer, sex worker, etc.) acts. In Being and Nothingness , Sartre uses the example of a waiter in \"bad faith\". He merely takes part in the \"act\" of being a typical waiter, albeit very convincingly. [ 46 ] This image usually corresponds to a social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic. The main point is the attitude one takes to one's own freedom and responsibility and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom. [ 47 ]\n",
      "The Other (written with a capital \"O\") is a concept more properly belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity . However, it has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences)—only from \"over there\"—the world is constituted as objective in that it is something that is \"there\" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things. This experience of the Other's look is what is termed the Look (sometimes the Gaze ). [ 48 ]\n",
      "While this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other's Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by him, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom. This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. When one experiences oneself in the Look, one does not experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something (some thing). In Sartre's example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole, the man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in. He is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is then filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing—as a Peeping Tom . For Sartre, this phenomenological experience of shame establishes proof for the existence of other minds and defeats the problem of solipsism . For the conscious state of shame to be experienced, one has to become aware of oneself as an object of another look, proving a priori, that other minds exist. [ 49 ] The Look is then co-constitutive of one's facticity.\n",
      "Another characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is possible that the creaking floorboard was simply the movement of an old house; the Look is not some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the Other sees one (there may have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that person). It is only one's perception of the way another might perceive him. [ 50 ]\n",
      "\"Existential angst\", sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or anguish , is a term common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] The archetypal example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that \"nothing is holding me back\", one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one's own freedom. [ 53 ]\n",
      "It can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing, and this is what sets it apart from fear that has an object. While one can take measures to remove an object of fear, for angst no such \"constructive\" measures are possible. The use of the word \"nothing\" in this context relates to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one's actions and to the fact that, in experiencing freedom as angst, one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences. There is nothing in people (genetically, for instance) that acts in their stead—that they can blame if something goes wrong. Therefore, not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences (and, it can be claimed, human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread). However, this does not change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action.\n",
      "Despair is generally defined as a loss of hope. [ 54 ] In existentialism, it is more specifically a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one's self or identity. If a person is invested in being a particular thing, such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen, and then finds their being-thing compromised, they would normally be found in a state of despair—a hopeless state. For example, a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if they have nothing else to fall back on—nothing to rely on for their identity. They find themselves unable to be what defined their being.\n",
      "What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when they are not overtly in despair. So long as a person's identity depends on qualities that can crumble, they are in perpetual despair—and as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. As Kierkegaard defines it in Either/Or : \"Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person's unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy.\" [ 55 ] In Works of Love , he says:\n",
      "When the God-forsaken worldliness of earthly life shuts itself in complacency, the confined air develops poison, the moment gets stuck and stands still, the prospect is lost, a need is felt for a refreshing, enlivening breeze to cleanse the air and dispel the poisonous vapors lest we suffocate in worldliness. ... Lovingly to hope all things is the opposite of despairingly to hope nothing at all. Love hopes all things—yet is never put to shame. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of evil is to fear. By the decision to choose hope one decides infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision.\n",
      "Existentialists oppose defining human beings as primarily rational, and, therefore, oppose both positivism and rationalism . Existentialism asserts that people make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality. \n",
      "The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the anxiety and dread that we feel in the face of our own radical free will and our awareness of death. Kierkegaard advocated rationality as a means to interact with the objective world (e.g., in the natural sciences), but when it comes to existential problems, reason is insufficient: \"Human reason has boundaries\". [ 56 ]\n",
      "Like Kierkegaard, Sartre saw problems with rationality, calling it a form of \"bad faith\", an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomena—\"the Other\"—that is fundamentally irrational and random. According to Sartre, rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom. To try to suppress feelings of anxiety and dread, people confine themselves within everyday experience, Sartre asserted, thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by \"the Look\" of \"the Other\" (i.e., possessed by another person—or at least one's idea of that other person). [ 57 ]\n",
      "An existentialist reading of the Bible would demand that the reader recognize that they are an existing subject studying the words more as a recollection of events. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of \"truths\" that are outside and unrelated to the reader, but may develop a sense of reality/God. Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing these commandments upon them, but as though they are inside them and guiding them from inside. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: \"Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life—or the learner who should put it to use?\" [ 58 ] Philosophers such as Hans Jonas and Rudolph Bultmann introduced the concept of existentialist demythologization into the field of Early Christianity and Christian Theology , respectively. [ 59 ]\n",
      "Although nihilism and existentialism are distinct philosophies, they are often confused with one another since both are rooted in the human experience of anguish and confusion that stems from the apparent meaninglessness of a world in which humans are compelled to find or create meaning. [ 60 ] A primary cause of confusion is that Friedrich Nietzsche was an important philosopher in both fields.\n",
      "Existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of angst as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action, a move that is often reduced to moral or existential nihilism . A pervasive theme in existentialist philosophy, however, is to persist through encounters with the absurd, as seen in Albert Camus 's philosophical essay The Myth of Sisyphus (1942): \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy\". [ 61 ] and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one's self-created meaning: Søren Kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious (although he would not agree that it was ethical; the religious suspends the ethical), and Jean-Paul Sartre 's final words in Being and Nothingness (1943): \"All these questions, which refer us to a pure and not an accessory (or impure) reflection, can find their reply only on the ethical plane. We shall devote to them a future work.\" [ 46 ]\n",
      "Some have argued that existentialism has long been an element of European religious thought, even before the term came into use. William Barrett identified Blaise Pascal and Søren Kierkegaard as two specific examples. [ 62 ] Jean Wahl also identified William Shakespeare 's Prince Hamlet (\" To be, or not to be \"), Jules Lequier , Thomas Carlyle , and William James as existentialists. According to Wahl, \"the origins of most great philosophies, like those of Plato , Descartes , and Kant , are to be found in existential reflections.\" [ 63 ] Precursors to existentialism can also be identified in the works of Iranian Muslim philosopher Mulla Sadra (c. 1571–1635), who would posit that \" existence precedes essence \" becoming the principle expositor of the School of Isfahan , which is described as \"alive and active\". [ according to whom? ]\n",
      "Kierkegaard is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher. [ 5 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] He proposed that each individual—not reason, society, or religious orthodoxy—is solely tasked with giving meaning to life and living it sincerely, or \"authentically\". [ 66 ] [ 67 ]\n",
      "Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though neither used the term \"existentialism\" and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20th century. They focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science, which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience. Like Pascal, they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom . Unlike Pascal, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices, particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs, and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser. [ 68 ] Kierkegaard's knight of faith and Nietzsche's Übermensch are representative of people who exhibit freedom , in that they define the nature of their own existence. Nietzsche's idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel under. By contrast, Kierkegaard, opposed to the level of abstraction in Hegel, and not nearly as hostile (actually welcoming) to Christianity as Nietzsche, argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths (specifically Christian) is not only impossible, but even founded on logical paradoxes. Yet he continues to imply that a leap of faith is a possible means for an individual to reach a higher stage of existence that transcends and contains both an aesthetic and ethical value of life. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements, including postmodernism , and various strands of psychotherapy. [ citation needed ] However, Kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking. [ 69 ]\n",
      "In Twilight of the Idols , Nietzsche's sentiments resonate the idea of \"existence precedes essence.\" He writes, \"no one gives man his qualities-- neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor he himself...No one is responsible for man's being there at all, for his being such-and-such, or for his being in these circumstances or in this environment...Man is not the effect of some special purpose of a will, and end...\" [ 70 ] Within this view, Nietzsche ties in his rejection of the existence of God, which he sees as a means to \"redeem the world.\" By rejecting the existence of God, Nietzsche also rejects beliefs that claim humans have a predestined purpose according to what God has instructed.\n",
      "The first important literary author also important to existentialism was the Russian, Dostoyevsky. [ 71 ] Dostoyevsky's Notes from Underground portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. Sartre, in his book on existentialism Existentialism is a Humanism , quoted Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov as an example of existential crisis . Other Dostoyevsky novels covered issues raised in existentialist philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism: for example, in Crime and Punishment , the protagonist Raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a Christian Orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by Dostoyevsky himself. [ 72 ]\n",
      "In the first decades of the 20th century, a number of philosophers and writers explored existentialist ideas. The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo , in his 1913 book The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations , emphasized the life of \"flesh and bone\" as opposed to that of abstract rationalism. Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual's quest for faith. He retained a sense of the tragic, even absurd nature of the quest, symbolized by his enduring interest in the eponymous character from the Miguel de Cervantes novel Don Quixote . A novelist, poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the University of Salamanca, Unamuno wrote a short story about a priest's crisis of faith, Saint Manuel the Good, Martyr , which has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction. Another Spanish thinker, José Ortega y Gasset , writing in 1914, held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: \" Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia \" (\"I am myself and my circumstances\"). Sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter, but is always situated (\" en situation \"). [ citation needed ]\n",
      "Although Martin Buber wrote his major philosophical works in German, and studied and taught at the Universities of Berlin and Frankfurt , he stands apart from the mainstream of German philosophy. Born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, he was also a scholar of Jewish culture and involved at various times in Zionism and Hasidism . In 1938, he moved permanently to Jerusalem . His best-known philosophical work was the short book I and Thou , published in 1922. [ 73 ] For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is \"man with man\", a dialogue that takes place in the so-called \"sphere of between\" ( \"das Zwischenmenschliche\" ). [ 74 ]\n",
      "Two Russian philosophers, Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev , became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post-Revolutionary exiles in Paris. Shestov had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms All Things Are Possible . Berdyaev drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects. Human freedom, for Berdyaev, is rooted in the realm of spirit, a realm independent of scientific notions of causation. To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom. \"Man\" is not to be interpreted naturalistically, but as a being created in God's image, an originator of free, creative acts. [ 75 ] He published a major work on these themes, The Destiny of Man , in 1931.\n",
      "Gabriel Marcel , long before coining the term \"existentialism\", introduced important existentialist themes to a French audience in his early essay \"Existence and Objectivity\" (1925) and in his Metaphysical Journal (1927). [ 76 ] A dramatist as well as a philosopher, Marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alienation: the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life. Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through \"secondary reflection\", a \"dialogical\" rather than \"dialectical\" approach to the world, characterized by \"wonder and astonishment\" and open to the \"presence\" of other people and of God rather than merely to \"information\" about them. For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted \"extravagant\" availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other. [ 77 ]\n",
      "Marcel contrasted secondary reflection with abstract, scientific-technical primary reflection , which he associated with the activity of the abstract Cartesian ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing, feeling human being incarnate—embodied—in a concrete world. [ 76 ] [ 78 ] Although Sartre adopted the term \"existentialism\" for his own philosophy in the 1940s, Marcel's thought has been described as \"almost diametrically opposed\" to that of Sartre. [ 76 ] Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929.\n",
      "In Germany, the psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers —who later described existentialism as a \"phantom\" created by the public [ 79 ] —called his own thought, heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, Existenzphilosophie . For Jaspers, \" Existenz -philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker\". [ 80 ]\n",
      "Jaspers, a professor at the university of Heidelberg , was acquainted with Heidegger, who held a professorship at Marburg before acceding to Husserl's chair at Freiburg in 1928. They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger's support of National Socialism . They shared an admiration for Kierkegaard, [ 81 ] and in the 1930s, Heidegger lectured extensively on Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In Being and Time he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence ( Dasein ) to be analysed in terms of existential categories ( existentiale ); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement.\n",
      "Following the Second World War, existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus , who wrote best-selling novels, plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts. [ 82 ] These years also saw the growing reputation of Being and Time outside Germany.\n",
      "Sartre dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel Nausea and the short stories in his 1939 collection The Wall , and had published his treatise on existentialism, Being and Nothingness , in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associates—Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others—became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism. [ 83 ] In a very short period of time, Camus and Sartre in particular became the leading public intellectuals of post-war France, achieving by the end of 1945 \"a fame that reached across all audiences.\" [ 84 ] Camus was an editor of the most popular leftist (former French Resistance ) newspaper Combat ; Sartre launched his journal of leftist thought, Les Temps Modernes , and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and secular humanism to a packed meeting of the Club Maintenant. Beauvoir wrote that \"not a week passed without the newspapers discussing us\"; [ 85 ] existentialism became \"the first media craze of the postwar era.\" [ 86 ]\n",
      "By the end of 1947, Camus' earlier fiction and plays had been reprinted, his new play Caligula had been performed and his novel The Plague published; the first two novels of Sartre's The Roads to Freedom trilogy had appeared, as had Beauvoir's novel The Blood of Others . Works by Camus and Sartre were already appearing in foreign editions. The Paris-based existentialists had become famous. [ 83 ]\n",
      "Sartre had traveled to Germany in 1930 to study the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger , [ 87 ] and he included critical comments on their work in his major treatise Being and Nothingness . Heidegger's thought had also become known in French philosophical circles through its use by Alexandre Kojève in explicating Hegel in a series of lectures given in Paris in the 1930s. [ 88 ] The lectures were highly influential; members of the audience included not only Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, but Raymond Queneau , Georges Bataille , Louis Althusser , André Breton , and Jacques Lacan . [ 89 ] A selection from Being and Time was published in French in 1938, and his essays began to appear in French philosophy journals.\n",
      "Heidegger read Sartre's work and was initially impressed, commenting: \"Here for the first time I encountered an independent thinker who, from the foundations up, has experienced the area out of which I think. Your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as I have never before encountered.\" [ 90 ] Later, however, in response to a question posed by his French follower Jean Beaufret , [ 91 ] Heidegger distanced himself from Sartre's position and existentialism in general in his Letter on Humanism . [ 92 ] Heidegger's reputation continued to grow in France during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, Sartre attempted to reconcile existentialism and Marxism in his work Critique of Dialectical Reason . A major theme throughout his writings was freedom and responsibility.\n",
      "Camus was a friend of Sartre, until their falling-out, and wrote several works with existential themes including The Rebel , Summer in Algiers , The Myth of Sisyphus , and The Stranger , the latter being \"considered—to what would have been Camus's irritation—the exemplary existentialist novel.\" [ 93 ] Camus, like many others, rejected the existentialist label, and considered his works concerned with facing the absurd. In the titular book, Camus uses the analogy of the Greek myth of Sisyphus to demonstrate the futility of existence. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill, but when he reaches the summit, the rock will roll to the bottom again. Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it. The first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus took to be existentialist philosophy in the works of Kierkegaard, Shestov, Heidegger, and Jaspers.\n",
      "Simone de Beauvoir , an important existentialist who spent much of her life as Sartre's partner, wrote about feminist and existentialist ethics in her works, including The Second Sex and The Ethics of Ambiguity . Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre, [ 94 ] de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus. [ 72 ]\n",
      "Paul Tillich , an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and Karl Barth , applied existentialist concepts to Christian theology , and helped introduce existential theology to the general public. His seminal work The Courage to Be follows Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety and life's absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life's absurdity. Rudolf Bultmann used Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's philosophy of existence to demythologize Christianity by interpreting Christian mythical concepts into existentialist concepts.\n",
      "Maurice Merleau-Ponty , an existential phenomenologist , was for a time a companion of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception (1945) was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism. [ 95 ] It has been said that Merleau-Ponty's work Humanism and Terror greatly influenced Sartre. However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir, [ 72 ] who sided with Sartre.\n",
      "Colin Wilson , an English writer, published his study The Outsider in 1956, initially to critical acclaim. In this book and others (e.g. Introduction to the New Existentialism ), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards. [ 96 ]\n",
      "Stanley Kubrick 's 1957 anti-war film Paths of Glory \"illustrates, and even illuminates...existentialism\" by examining the \"necessary absurdity of the human condition \" and the \"horror of war\". [ 97 ] The film tells the story of a fictional World War I French army regiment ordered to attack an impregnable German stronghold; when the attack fails, three soldiers are chosen at random, court-martialed by a \" kangaroo court \", and executed by firing squad. The film examines existentialist ethics, such as the issue of whether objectivity is possible and the \"problem of authenticity \". [ 97 ] Orson Welles 's 1962 film The Trial , based upon Franz Kafka's book of the same name ( Der Prozeß ), is characteristic of both existentialist and absurdist themes in its depiction of a man (Joseph K.) arrested for a crime for which the charges are neither revealed to him nor to the reader.\n",
      "Neon Genesis Evangelion is a Japanese science fiction animation series created by the anime studio Gainax and was both directed and written by Hideaki Anno . Existential themes of individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility are heavily relied upon throughout the entire series, particularly through the philosophies of Jean-Paul Sartre and Søren Kierkegaard . Episode 16's title, \"The Sickness Unto Death, And...\" ( 死に至る病、そして , Shi ni itaru yamai, soshite ) is a reference to Kierkegaard's book, The Sickness Unto Death .\n",
      "Some contemporary films dealing with existentialist issues include Melancholia , Fight Club , I Heart Huckabees , Waking Life , The Matrix , Ordinary People , Life in a Day , Barbie , and Everything Everywhere All at Once . [ 98 ] Likewise, films throughout the 20th century such as The Seventh Seal , Ikiru , Taxi Driver , the Toy Story films , The Great Silence , Ghost in the Shell , Harold and Maude , High Noon , Easy Rider , One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest , A Clockwork Orange , Groundhog Day , Apocalypse Now , Badlands , and Blade Runner also have existentialist qualities. [ 99 ]\n",
      "Notable directors known for their existentialist films include Ingmar Bergman , Bela Tarr , Robert Bresson , Jean-Pierre Melville , François Truffaut , Jean-Luc Godard , Michelangelo Antonioni , Akira Kurosawa , Terrence Malick , Stanley Kubrick , Andrei Tarkovsky , Éric Rohmer , Wes Anderson , Woody Allen , and Christopher Nolan . [ 100 ] Charlie Kaufman 's Synecdoche, New York focuses on the protagonist's desire to find existential meaning. [ 101 ] Similarly, in Kurosawa's Red Beard , the protagonist's experiences as an intern in a rural health clinic in Japan lead him to an existential crisis whereby he questions his reason for being. This, in turn, leads him to a better understanding of humanity. The French film, Mood Indigo (directed by Michel Gondry ) embraced various elements of existentialism. [ citation needed ] The film The Shawshank Redemption , released in 1994, depicts life in a prison in Maine , United States to explore several existentialist concepts. [ 102 ]\n",
      "Existential perspectives are also found in modern literature to varying degrees, especially since the 1920s. Louis-Ferdinand Céline 's Journey to the End of the Night ( Voyage au bout de la nuit , 1932) celebrated by both Sartre and Beauvoir, contained many of the themes that would be found in later existential literature, and is in some ways, the proto-existential novel. Jean-Paul Sartre's 1938 novel Nausea [ 103 ] was \"steeped in Existential ideas\", and is considered an accessible way of grasping his philosophical stance. [ 104 ] Between 1900 and 1960, other authors such as Albert Camus , Franz Kafka , Rainer Maria Rilke , T. S. Eliot , Yukio Mishima , Hermann Hesse , Luigi Pirandello , [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 39 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Ralph Ellison , [ 108 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] and Jack Kerouac composed literature or poetry that contained, to varying degrees, elements of existential or proto-existential thought. The philosophy's influence even reached pulp literature shortly after the turn of the 20th century, as seen in the existential disparity witnessed in Man's lack of control of his fate in the works of H. P. Lovecraft . [ 112 ]\n",
      "Sartre wrote No Exit in 1944, an existentialist play originally published in French as Huis Clos (meaning In Camera or \"behind closed doors\"), which is the source of the popular quote, \"Hell is other people.\" (In French, \"L'enfer, c'est les autres\"). The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell. Eventually he is joined by two women. After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked. All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives. Instead, they realize they are there to torture each other, which they do effectively by probing each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories.\n",
      "Existentialist themes are displayed in the Theatre of the Absurd , notably in Samuel Beckett 's Waiting for Godot , in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives. They claim Godot is an acquaintance, but in fact, hardly know him, admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him. Samuel Beckett, once asked who or what Godot is, replied, \"If I knew, I would have said so in the play.\" To occupy themselves, the men eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play games, exercise , swap hats, and contemplate suicide —anything \"to hold the terrible silence at bay\". [ 113 ] The play \"exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and pathos .\" [ 114 ] The play also illustrates an attitude toward human experience on earth: the poignancy, oppression, camaraderie, hope, corruption, and bewilderment of human experience that can be reconciled only in the mind and art of the absurdist. The play examines questions such as death, the meaning of human existence and the place of God in human existence.\n",
      "Tom Stoppard 's Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead is an absurdist tragicomedy first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966. [ 115 ] The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet . Comparisons have also been drawn to Samuel Beckett 's Waiting for Godot , for the presence of two central characters who appear almost as two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions , impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time. The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding. They stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications, and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world.\n",
      "Jean Anouilh 's Antigone also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas. [ 116 ] It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name ( Antigone , by Sophocles) from the fifth century BC. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately \"Ante-GŌN.\" The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation have been drawn. Antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death. The crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power, fate, and choice, during which Antigone says that she is, \"... disgusted with [the]...promise of a humdrum happiness.\" She states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence.\n",
      "Critic Martin Esslin in his book Theatre of the Absurd pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as Samuel Beckett , Eugène Ionesco , Jean Genet , and Arthur Adamov wove into their plays the existentialist belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning. Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled \"Absurdist\" (based on Esslin's book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with 'Pataphysics or with Surrealism than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin's observation. [ 117 ]\n",
      "Black existentialism explores the existence and experiences of Black people in the world. [ 118 ] Classical and contemporary thinkers include C.L.R James , Frederick Douglass , W.E.B DuBois , Frantz Fanon , Angela Davis , Cornel West , Naomi Zack , bell hooks , Stuart Hall , Lewis Gordon , and Audre Lorde . [ 119 ]\n",
      "A major offshoot of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized in the work of Otto Rank , Freud's closest associate for 20 years. Without awareness of the writings of Rank, Ludwig Binswanger was influenced by Freud , Edmund Husserl , Heidegger , and Sartre . A later figure was Viktor Frankl , who briefly met Freud as a young man. [ 120 ] His logotherapy can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy. The existentialists would also influence social psychology , antipositivist micro- sociology , symbolic interactionism , and post-structuralism , with the work of thinkers such as Georg Simmel [ 121 ] and Michel Foucault . Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers to this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive. [ 122 ]\n",
      "An early contributor to existentialist psychology in the United States was Rollo May , who was strongly influenced by Kierkegaard and Otto Rank . One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the US is Irvin D. Yalom . Yalom states that\n",
      "Aside from their reaction against Freud's mechanistic, deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy, the existentialist analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school. These thinkers—who include Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss , Eugène Minkowski , V. E. Gebsattel, Roland Kuhn, G. Caruso, F. T. Buytendijk, G. Bally, and Victor Frankl—were almost entirely unknown to the American psychotherapeutic community until Rollo May's highly influential 1958 book Existence —and especially his introductory essay—introduced their work into this country. [ 123 ]\n",
      "A more recent contributor to the development of a European version of existentialist psychotherapy is the British-based Emmy van Deurzen . [ 124 ]\n",
      "Anxiety's importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in psychotherapy . Therapists often offer existentialist philosophy as an explanation for anxiety. The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual's complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions. Psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. By embracing anxiety as inevitable, a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life. Humanistic psychology also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets. Terror management theory , based on the writings of Ernest Becker and Otto Rank , is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology. It looks at what researchers claim are implicit emotional reactions of people confronted with the knowledge that they will eventually die. [ 125 ]\n",
      "Also, Gerd B. Achenbach has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of philosophical counseling ; as did Michel Weber with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium. [ citation needed ]\n",
      "Walter Kaufmann criticized \"the profoundly unsound methods and the dangerous contempt for reason that have been so prominent in existentialism.\" [ 126 ] Logical positivist philosophers, such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer , assert that existentialists are often confused about the verb \"to be\" in their analyses of \"being\". [ 127 ] Specifically, they argue that the verb \"is\" is transitive and pre-fixed to a predicate (e.g., an apple is red ) (without a predicate, the word \"is\" is meaningless), and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner. Wilson has stated in his book The Angry Years that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties: \"We can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post-romantic philosophy, with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and boredom , we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging, and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole.\" [ 128 ]\n",
      "Many critics argue Sartre's philosophy is contradictory. For example, see Magda Stroe's arguments. Specifically, they argue that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics . Herbert Marcuse criticized Being and Nothingness for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: \"Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it hypostatizes specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory.\" [ 129 ]\n",
      "In Letter on Humanism , Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:\n",
      "Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking existentia and essentia according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that essentia precedes existentia . Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being. [ 130 ]\n"

      "Epicureanism is a system of philosophy founded around 307 BCE based upon the teachings of Epicurus , an ancient Greek philosopher . Epicurus was an atomist and materialist , following in the steps of Democritus . His materialism led him to religious skepticism and a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism , and its main opponent later became Stoicism . It is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal. However, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from hedonism as colloquially understood.\n",
      "Following the Cyrenaic philosopher Aristippus , Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of ataraxia (tranquility and freedom from fear) and aponia (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires. Correspondingly, Epicurus and his followers generally withdrew from politics because it could lead to frustrations and ambitions that would conflict with their pursuit of virtue and peace of mind. [ 1 ]\n",
      "Few writings by Epicurus have survived. Diogenes Laërtius preserves three letters written by Epicurus, as well as a list of the Principal Doctrines of Epicureanism; however, there are independent attestations of his ideas from his later disciples. The epic poem De rerum natura (Latin for \"On the Nature of Things\") by Lucretius presents the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism in one unified work. Many Epicurean texts have also been found on scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum , mostly works written by the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus or his teacher Zeno of Sidon along with fragments of works by Epicurus himself. Diogenes of Oenoanda , a wealthy Epicurean in the 2nd century CE, had a portico wall inscribed with tenets of the philosophy erected in Oenoanda , Lycia (present day Turkey).\n",
      "Epicureanism flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era, and many Epicurean communities were established in places such as Antioch , Alexandria , Rhodes , and Herculaneum . By the late 3rd century CE, Epicureanism all but died out, being opposed by other philosophies (mainly Neoplatonism ) that were then in the ascent. Interest in Epicureanism was resurrected in the Age of Enlightenment and continues in the modern era.\n",
      "Epicurus taught and gained followers in Mytilene , the capital of the island Lesbos , and then in Lampsacus . In Athens , Epicurus bought a property for his school called \"Garden\", which later became the name of Epicurus' school. [ 2 ] Its members included Hermarchus , Idomeneus , Colotes , Polyaenus , and Metrodorus . Epicurus emphasized friendship as an important ingredient of happiness, and the school seems to have been a moderately ascetic community which rejected the political limelight of Athenian philosophy. They were fairly cosmopolitan by Athenian standards, including women and slaves. Community activities held some importance, particularly the observance of Eikas , a monthly social gathering. Some members were also vegetarians as, from slight evidence, Epicurus did not eat meat, although no prohibition against eating meat was made. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]\n",
      "The school's popularity grew and it became, along with Stoicism , Platonism , Peripateticism , and Pyrrhonism , one of the dominant schools of Hellenistic philosophy , lasting strongly through the later Roman Empire . [ 5 ] Deciphered carbonized scrolls obtained from the library at the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum contain a large number of works by Philodemus , a late Hellenistic Epicurean, and Epicurus himself, attesting to the school's enduring popularity. Julius Caesar also leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, which led to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against Catiline , during the Catiline conspiracy where he spoke out against the Stoic Cato . [ 6 ] His father-in-law, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus , was also an adept of the school. In the 2nd century CE, comedian Lucian of Samosata and wealthy promoter of philosophy Diogenes of Oenoanda were prominent Epicureans.\n",
      "By the late third century CE, however, there was little trace of its existence. [ 7 ] With growing dominance of Neoplatonism and Peripateticism , and later, Christianity , Epicureanism declined.\n",
      "In his letter to Herodotus , Epicurus presented three principles as to the nature of the physical world, i.e. that that which exists cannot come into being from that which does not exist, that which is destroyed does not cease to exist, and all that exists now always did exist and always will. [ 8 ] The object of these principles was to establish the fact that all that constitutes the world is permanent and unchanging. [ 9 ] Epicurean physics held that the entire universe consisted of two things: matter and void. [ 10 ] Matter is made up of atoms, which are tiny bodies that have only the unchanging qualities of shape, size, and weight. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The Epicureans believed that atoms were unchanging because the world was ordered and that changes had to have specific and consistent sources, e.g. a plant species only grows from a seed of the same species, [ 13 ] [ 14 ] but that in order for the universe to persist, what it is ultimately made up of must not be able to be changed or else the universe would be essentially destroyed. [ 15 ] [ 13 ]\n",
      "Epicurus holds that there must be an infinite supply of atoms, although only a finite number of types of atoms, as well as an infinite amount of void. [ 11 ] Epicurus explains this position in his letter to Herodotus:\n",
      "Moreover, the sum of things is unlimited both by reason of the multitude of the atoms and the extent of the void. For if the void were infinite and bodies finite, the bodies would not have stayed anywhere but would have been dispersed in their course through the infinite void, not having any supports or counterchecks to send them back on their upward rebound. Again, if the void were finite, the infinity of bodies would not have anywhere to be. [ 16 ]\n",
      "Because of the infinite supply of atoms, there are an infinite number of worlds, or cosmoi . [ 11 ] Some of these worlds could be vastly different from our own, some quite similar, and all of the worlds were separated from each other by vast areas of void ( metakosmia ). [ 11 ]\n",
      "Epicureanism states that atoms are unable to be broken down into any smaller parts [ 15 ] because void is necessary for matter to move. Anything which consists of both void and matter can be broken down, while if something contains no void then it has no way to break apart because no part of the substance could be broken down into a smaller subsection of the substance. [ 13 ] Atoms are constantly moving in one of four different ways. [ 17 ] Atoms can simply collide with each other and then bounce off of each other. [ 17 ] When joined with each other and forming a larger object, atoms can vibrate as they collide into each other while still maintaining the overall shape of the larger object. [ 17 ]\n",
      "When not prevented by other atoms, all atoms move at the same speed naturally downwards in relation to the rest of the world. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] This downwards motion is natural for atoms; however, as their fourth means of motion, atoms can at times randomly swerve out of their usual downwards path. [ 18 ] This swerving motion is what allowed for the creation of the universe, since as more and more atoms swerved and collided with each other, objects were able to take shape as the atoms joined together. Without the swerve, the atoms would never have interacted with each other, and simply continued to move downwards at the same speed. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Epicurus also felt that the swerve was what accounted for humanity's free will. [ 19 ] If it were not for the swerve, humans would be subject to a never-ending chain of cause and effect. [ 19 ] This was a point which Epicureans often used to criticize Democritus ' atomic theory . [ 19 ]\n",
      "Epicurean philosophy employs an empirical epistemology, one based on the senses. [ 20 ]\n",
      "Epicureans believed that senses also relied on atoms. Every object was continually emitting particles from itself that would then interact with the observer. [ 21 ] All sensations, such as sight, smell, or sound, relied on these particles. [ 21 ] While the atoms that were emitted did not have the qualities that the senses were perceiving, the manner in which they were emitted caused the observer to experience those sensations, e.g. red particles were not themselves red but  were emitted in a manner that caused the viewer to experience the color red. [ 21 ] The atoms are not perceived individually, but rather as a continuous sensation because of how quickly they move. [ 21 ]\n",
      "The Epicureans believed that all sense perceptions were true, [ 22 ] [ 23 ] and that errors arise in how we judge those perceptions. [ 23 ] When we form judgments about things ( hupolepsis ), they can be verified and corrected through further sensory information. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] For example, if someone sees a tower from far away that appears to be round, and upon approaching the tower they see that it is actually square, they would come to realize that their original judgement was wrong and correct their wrong opinion. [ 26 ]\n",
      "Epicurus is said to have proposed three criteria of truth : sensations ( aisthêsis ), preconceptions ( prolepsis ), and feelings ( pathê ). [ 27 ] A fourth criterion called \"presentational applications of the mind\" ( phantastikai epibolai tês dianoias ) was said to have been added by later Epicureans. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] These criteria formed the method through which Epicureans thought we gained knowledge. [ 20 ]\n",
      "Since Epicureans thought that sensations could not deceive, sensations are the first and main criterion of truth for Epicureans. [ 23 ] Even in cases where sensory input seems to mislead, the input itself is true and the error arises from our judgments about the input. For example, when one places a straight oar in the water, it appears bent. The Epicurean would argue that the image of the oar, that is, the atoms traveling from the oar to the observer's eyes, has been shifted and thus really does arrive at the observer's eyes in the shape of a bent oar. [ 29 ] The observer makes the error in assuming that the image he or she receives correctly represents the oar and has not been distorted in some way. [ 29 ] In order to not make erroneous judgments about perceivable things and instead verify one's judgment, Epicureans believed that one needed to obtain \"clear vision\" ( enargeia ) of the perceivable thing by closer examination. [ 30 ] This acted as a justification for one's judgements about the thing being perceived. [ 30 ] Enargeia is characterized as sensation of an object that has been unchanged by judgments or opinions and is a clear and direct perception of that object. [ 31 ]\n",
      "An individual's preconceptions are his or her concepts of what things are, e.g. what someone's idea of a horse is, and these concepts are formed in a person's mind through sensory input over time. [ 32 ] When the word that relates to the preconception is used, these preconceptions are summoned up by the mind into the person's thoughts. [ 33 ] It is through our preconceptions that we are able to make judgments about the things that we perceive. [ 26 ] Preconceptions were also used by Epicureans to avoid the paradox proposed by Plato in the Meno regarding learning. [ 33 ] Plato argues that learning requires us to already have knowledge of what we are learning, or else we would be unable to recognize when we had successfully learned the information. [ 33 ] Preconceptions, Epicureans argue, provide individuals with that pre-knowledge required for learning. [ 33 ]\n",
      "Our feelings or emotions ( pathê ) are how we perceive pleasure and pain. [ 28 ] They are analogous to sensations in that they are a means of perception, but they perceive our internal state as opposed to external things. [ 28 ] According to Diogenes Laertius, feelings are how we determine our actions. If something is pleasurable, we pursue that thing, and if something is painful, we avoid that thing. [ 28 ]\n",
      "The idea of \"presentational applications of the mind\" is an explanation for how we can discuss and inquire about things we cannot directly perceive. [ 34 ] We receive impressions of such things directly in our minds, instead of perceiving them through other senses. [ 27 ] The concept of \"presentational applications of the mind\" may have been introduced to explain how we learn about things that we cannot directly perceive, such as the gods. [ 27 ] [ 34 ]\n",
      "Epicureanism bases its ethics on a hedonistic set of values, seeing pleasure as the chief good in life. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Hence, Epicurus advocated living in such a way as to derive the greatest amount of pleasure possible during one's lifetime, yet doing so moderately in order to avoid the suffering incurred by overindulgence in such pleasure. [ 35 ] Epicurus actively recommended against passionate love, and believed it best to avoid marriage altogether. He viewed recreational sex as a natural, but not necessary, desire that should be generally avoided. [ 37 ] Since the political life could give rise to desires that could disturb virtue and one's peace of mind, such as a lust for power or a desire for fame, participation in politics was discouraged. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Further, Epicurus sought to eliminate the fear of the gods and of death , seeing those two fears as chief causes of strife in life. [ 40 ]\n",
      "When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do by some through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.\n",
      "Epicureans had a very specific understanding of what the greatest pleasure was, and the focus of their ethics was on the avoidance of pain rather than seeking out pleasure. [ 42 ] As evidence for this, Epicureans say that nature seems to command us to avoid pain, and they point out that all animals try to avoid pain as much as possible. [ 43 ] Epicureanism divided pleasure into two broad categories: pleasures of the body and pleasures of the mind . [ 42 ] Pleasures of the body involve sensations of the body, such as the act of eating delicious food or of being in a state of comfort free from pain, and exist only in the present. [ 42 ] One can only experience pleasures of the body in the moment, meaning they only exist as a person is experiencing them. [ 44 ] Pleasures of the mind involve mental processes and states; feelings of joy, the lack of fear, and pleasant memories are all examples of pleasures of the mind. [ 42 ] These pleasures of the mind do not only exist in the present, but also in the past and future, since memory of a past pleasant experience or the expectation of some potentially pleasing future can both be pleasurable experiences. [ 44 ] Because of this, the pleasures of the mind are considered to be greater than those of the body. [ 44 ]\n",
      "Emphasis was placed on pleasures of the mind rather than on physical pleasures. [ 35 ] The Epicureans further divided each of these types of pleasures into two categories: kinetic pleasure and katastematic pleasure . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Absence of pain, aponia , and lack of disturbance of mind, ataraxia , are two of the katastematic pleasures and often seen as the focal ones to Epicurus . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Kinetic pleasure is the physical or mental pleasures that involve action or change. [ 50 ] Eating delicious food, as well as fulfilling desires and removing pain, which is itself considered a pleasurable act, are all examples of kinetic pleasure in the physical sense. [ 45 ] [ 51 ] According to Epicurus, feelings of joy would be an example of mental kinetic pleasure. [ 45 ] Katastematic pleasure is the pleasure one feels while in a state without pain. [ 51 ] Like kinetic pleasures, katastematic pleasures can also be physical, such as the state of not being thirsty, or mental, such as freedom from a state of fear. [ 45 ] [ 50 ] Complete physical katastematic pleasure is called aponia , and complete mental katastematic pleasure is called ataraxia . [ 45 ]\n",
      "While the pursuit of pleasure formed the focal point of the philosophy, this was largely directed to the \"static pleasures\" of minimizing pain, anxiety and suffering. From this understanding, Epicureans concluded that the greatest pleasure a person could reach was the complete removal of all pain, both physical and mental. [ 52 ] The ultimate goal then of Epicurean ethics was to reach a state of aponia and ataraxia . [ 52 ]\n",
      "I learn that your bodily inclination leans most keenly towards sexual intercourse. If you neither violate the laws nor disturb well established morals nor sadden someone close to you, nor strain your body, nor spend what is needed for necessities, use your own choice as you wish. It is sure difficult to imagine, however, that none of these would be a part of sex because sex never benefitted anyone.\n",
      "In order to do this an Epicurean had to control their desires, because desire itself was seen as painful. [ 54 ] Not only will controlling one's desires bring about aponia , as one will rarely suffer from not being physically satisfied, but controlling one's desires will also help to bring about ataraxia because one will not be anxious about becoming discomforted since one would have so few desires anyway. [ 55 ] The Epicureans divide desires into three classes: natural and necessary, natural but not necessary, and vain and empty: [ 54 ]\n",
      "If one follows only natural and necessary desires, then, according to Epicurus, one would be able to reach aponia and ataraxia and thereby the highest form of happiness. [ 56 ] Unnecessary and, especially, artificially produced desires were to be suppressed. [ 57 ]\n",
      "It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life. [ 58 ]\n",
      "The Epicurean understanding of justice was inherently self-interested. Justice was deemed good because it was seen as mutually beneficial. [ 59 ] Individuals would not act unjustly even if the act was initially unnoticed because of possibly being caught and punished. [ 60 ] Both punishment and fear of punishment would cause a person disturbance and prevent them from being happy. [ 60 ]\n",
      "Epicurus was also an early thinker to develop the notion of justice as a social contract , and in part attempts to address issues with the society described in Plato 's Republic . [ 61 ] The social contract theory established by Epicureanism is based on mutual agreement, not divine decree. [ 61 ] He defined justice as an agreement made by people not to harm each other. [ 59 ] The point of living in a society with laws and punishments is to be protected from harm so that one is free to pursue happiness. [ 61 ] Because of this, laws that do not contribute to promoting human happiness are not just. [ 61 ] He gave his own unique version of the ethic of reciprocity , which differs from other formulations by emphasizing minimizing harm and maximizing happiness for oneself and others:\n",
      "Epicurean ideas on politics disagree with other philosophical traditions, namely the Stoic, Platonist and Aristotelian traditions. [ 62 ] To Epicureans all our social relations are a matter of how we perceive each other, of customs and traditions. No one is inherently of higher value or meant to dominate another. [ 1 ] That is because there is no metaphysical basis for the superiority of one kind of person, all people are made of the same atomic material and are thus naturally equal. [ 1 ] Epicureans also discourage political participation and other involvement in politics. [ 1 ] However Epicureans are not apolitical , it is possible that some political association could be seen as beneficial by some Epicureans. [ 62 ] Some political associations could lead to certain benefits to the individual that would help to maximize pleasure and avoid physical or mental distress. [ 62 ]\n",
      "of all the things which wisdom has contrived which contribute to a blessed life, none is more important, more fruitful, than friendship\n",
      "Epicurus laid great emphasis on developing friendships as the basis of a satisfying life. The avoidance or freedom from hardship and fear is ideal to the Epicureans. [ 62 ] While this avoidance or freedom could conceivably be achieved through political means, it was insisted by Epicurus that involvement in politics would not release one from fear and he advised against a life of politics. [ 62 ] Epicurus also discouraged contributing to political society by starting a family, as the benefits of a wife and children are outweighed by the trouble brought about by having a family. [ 62 ] Instead Epicurus encouraged a formation of a community of friends outside the traditional political state. This community of virtuous friends would focus on internal affairs and justice. [ 62 ] However, Epicureanism is adaptable to circumstance as is the Epicurean approach to politics. [ 62 ] The same approaches will not always work in protection from pain and fear. In some situations it will be more beneficial to have a family and in other situations it will be more beneficial to participate in politics. It is ultimately up to the Epicurean to analyse their circumstance and take whatever action befits the situation. [ 62 ]\n",
      "Epicureanism rejects immortality . It believes in the soul, but suggests that the soul is mortal and material, just like the body. [ 64 ] Epicurus rejected any possibility of an afterlife, while still contending that one need not fear death: \"Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.\" [ 65 ] From this doctrine arose the Epicurean Epitaph: Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo (\"I was not; I have been; I am not; I do not mind.\"), which is inscribed on the gravestones of his followers and seen on many ancient gravestones of the Roman Empire . [ 66 ]\n",
      "Epicureanism does not deny the existence of the gods; rather it denies their involvement in the world. According to Epicureanism, the gods do not interfere with human lives or the rest of the universe in any way [ 67 ] – thus, it shuns the idea that frightening weather events are divine retribution. [ 68 ] One of the fears the Epicurean ought to be freed from is fear relating to the actions of the gods. [ 69 ]\n",
      "The manner in which the Epicurean gods exist is still disputed. Some scholars say that Epicureanism believes that the gods exist outside the mind as material objects (the realist position), while others assert that the gods only exist in our minds as ideals (the idealist position). [ 67 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] The realist position holds that Epicureans understand the gods as existing as physical and immortal beings made of atoms that reside somewhere in reality. [ 67 ] [ 71 ] However, the gods are completely separate from the rest of reality; they are uninterested in it, play no role in it, and remain completely undisturbed by it. [ 72 ] Instead, the gods live in what is called the metakosmia , or the space between worlds. [ 73 ] Contrarily, the idealist (sometimes called the \"non-realist position\" to avoid confusion) position holds that the gods are just idealized forms of the best human life, [ 70 ] [ 74 ] and it is thought that the gods were emblematic of the life one should aspire towards. [ 70 ] The debate between these two positions was revived by A. A. Long and David Sedley in their 1987 book, The Hellenistic Philosophers , in which the two argued in favour of the idealist position. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] While a scholarly consensus has yet to be reached, the realist position remains the prevailing viewpoint at this time. [ 70 ] [ 71 ]\n",
      "On Nature ( Ancient Greek : Περὶ φύσεως ) is the name of a philosophical treatise in 37 books consisting of lectures written by Epicurus, [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] which can be considered his main work, however, it has mostly been lost. Some excerpts have survived compiled from burnt papyri scrolls found in the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum . Most of the surviving papyri are kept in the National Library of Naples . Important parts of Book II are preserved in the British Museum . [ 75 ] [ 76 ]\n",
      "Since most of the 37 books \"On Nature\" are lost, [ 78 ] the Principal Doctrines and Epicurus' Letters to Herodotus, Menoeceus, and Pythocles are the most authoritative writings on Epicureanism. Similarly, Lucretius' poem De rerum natura probably follows Epicurus' work. [ 76 ]\n",
      "The Principal Doctrines are forty authoritative conclusions set up as official doctrines by Epicurus, Metrodorus of Lampsacus , Hermarchus of Mitilene and Polyaenus of Lampsacus .  The Principal Doctrines exemplify the Epicurean philosophers' practice of publishing summaries and outlines of their teachings for easy memorization. However, they are so concise and short that it's difficult to understand them in depth without the context of additional commentaries and writings by ancient sources or by modern Epicurean practitioners, whenever possible.They are often cited as \"PDs\" in English.\n",
      "Some of the Principal Doctrines are organized into groups and are meant to be studied together. The first four doctrines make up the Tetrapharmakos (Four Cures). PD's 10-13 discuss the Epicurean philosophy of science. PD's 18-21 explain the natural limits of desires and in time, and how the flesh is unable to learn these limits but the mind can. PD's 22-25 deal with the importance of the canon, or the Epicurean standard of truth. PD's 31-38 explain the Epicurean doctrines on justice based on mutual advantage and contractarianism. [ 79 ] PD's 39-40 call for an intimate society of friends.\n",
      "Tetrapharmakos, or \"The four-part cure\", is Philodemus of Gadara 's basic guideline as to how to live the happiest possible life, based on the first four of the doctrines. This poetic doctrine was handed down by an anonymous Epicurean who summed up Epicurus' philosophy on happiness in four simple lines:\n",
      "Don't fear god, Don't worry about death; What is good is easy to get, and What is terrible is easy to endure.\n",
      "Three letters of Epicurus are preserved by Diogenes Laertius.\n",
      "Epicurus' Letter to Herodotus (not the historian) [ 80 ] was written as an introduction to Epicurean philosophy and method of studying nature. It included the most complete detail of the ancient conversations that led to the development of atomist theory, a doctrine of innumerable worlds, and an explanation of the phenomenon of time that posits an early form of relativism. [ 81 ] Epicurus' Letter to Herodotus appears to be a summary of On Nature , books I–XIII. [ 82 ]\n",
      "Epicurus' Letter to Pythocles is the second letter preserved by Diogenes Laertius in The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers. [ 83 ] In Letter to Pythocles, Epicurus treats the things for which there is uncertainty in how they occur. His train of thought is explicated through meteorological phenomena: various weather events as well as celestial phenomena in space such as asteroids, the creation and destruction of cosmoi, and the paths of planetary bodies through space. In Epicurus' time, long before any modern technological advances such as microscopes or telescopes which allow us to establish greater knowledge of these phenomena, these were all examples of things that, as far as the limits of human knowledge extended, it was impossible to establish certainty with regards to their causes, or how they occurred. Epicurus elaborates on how one may reason regarding such things so as to come to reasonable conclusions without undue certainty, so as to maintain Ataraxia .\n",
      "Epicurus' Letter to Menoeceus is a summary of his ethical teachings written in the epistolary literary style, and addressed to a student. It addresses theology, the hierarchies of desires, how to carry choices and avoidances in order to achieve net pleasure, and other aspects of Epicurean ethics . [ 84 ]\n",
      "The Epicurea is a collection of texts, fragments, and testimonies by Epicurus that was collected by Hermann Usener in 1887. This work features a collection of writings by Epicurus that explain the values and beliefs of Ancient Epicurian philosophy. [ 85 ]\n",
      "One of the earliest Roman writers espousing Epicureanism was Amafinius , although his work has not survived. Other adherents to the teachings of Epicurus included Lucretius , who wrote the poem De rerum natura about the tenets of the philosophy. The Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara , until the 18th century only known as a poet of minor importance, rose to prominence as much of his work, along with other Epicurean material such as the lectures of Zeno of Sidon , was discovered in the Villa of the Papyri .  Another major source of information is the Roman politician and philosopher Cicero , although he was highly critical, denouncing the Epicureans as unbridled hedonists , devoid of a sense of virtue and duty, and guilty of withdrawing from public life. Another ancient source is Diogenes of Oenoanda , who composed a large inscription at Oenoanda in Lycia . Diogenes Laërtius reports slanderous stories, circulated by Epicurus' opponents. [ 2 ]\n",
      "The early Christian writer Lactantius criticizes Epicurus at several points throughout his Divine Institutes and preserves the Riddle of Epicurus , or Problem of evil , a famous argument against the existence of an all-powerful and providential God or gods. [ 86 ] This type of trilemma argument (God is omnipotent, God is good, but Evil exists) was one favoured by the ancient Greek skeptics , and this argument may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an atheist . [ 87 ] According to Reinhold F. Glei , it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not Epicurean, but even anti-Epicurean. [ 88 ] The earliest extant version of this trilemma appears in the writings of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus . [ 89 ]\n",
      "Epikoros is a Jewish term figuratively meaning \"a heretic\", cited in the Mishnah , referring to one who does not have a share in the world to come [ 90 ] Although rabbinic literature does not make any specific reference to the Greek philosopher Epicurus , it is apparent that the term is derived from the philosopher's name, [ 91 ] in reference to his views which contradicted Jewish scripture, the strictly monotheistic conception of God in Judaism and the Jewish belief in the world to come .\n",
      "In Dante Alighieri 's Divine Comedy , the Epicureans are depicted as heretics suffering in the sixth circle of hell . In fact, Epicurus appears to represent the ultimate heresy. [ 92 ]\n",
      "Francis Bacon wrote an apothegm related to Epicureanism:\n",
      "There was an Epicurean vaunted, that divers of other sects of philosophers did after turn Epicureans, but there was never any Epicurean that turned to any other sect. Whereupon a philosopher that was of another sect, said; The reason was plain, for that cocks may be made capons , but capons could never be made cocks. [ 93 ]\n",
      "This echoed what the Academic skeptic philosopher Arcesilaus had said when asked \"why it was that pupils from all the other schools went over to Epicurus, but converts were never made from the Epicureans?\" to which he responded: \"Because men may become eunuchs , but a eunuch never becomes a man.\" [ 94 ]\n",
      "In the 17th century, the French Franciscan priest, scientist and philosopher Pierre Gassendi wrote two books forcefully reviving Epicureanism. Shortly thereafter, and clearly influenced by Gassendi, Walter Charleton published several works on Epicureanism in English. Attacks by Christians continued, most forcefully by the Cambridge Platonists . [ 95 ]\n",
      "In modern times Thomas Jefferson referred to himself as an Epicurean:\n",
      "If I had time I would add to my little book the Greek, Latin and French texts, in columns side by side. And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gassendi's Syntagma of the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the Stoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining of the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and fruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects. [ 96 ]\n",
      "Other modern-day Epicureans were Gassendi , Walter Charleton , François Bernier , Saint-Évremond , Ninon de l'Enclos , Denis Diderot , Frances Wright and Jeremy Bentham .\n",
      "In France, where perfumer/restaurateur Gérald Ghislain refers to himself as an Epicurean, [ citation needed ] Michel Onfray is developing a post-modern approach to Epicureanism. [ 97 ] In his 2011 book titled The Swerve , Stephen Greenblatt identified himself as strongly sympathetic to Epicureanism and Lucretius. Humanistic Judaism as a denomination also claims the Epicurean label.\n",
      "Some scholars have drawn parallels between Epicureanism and some eastern philosophies that similarly emphasize atomism or a lack of divine interference, such as Jainism , Charvaka , and Buddhism . [ 98 ] Epicureanism also resembles Buddhism in its belief that great excess leads to great dissatisfaction. [ 99 ] [ 100 ]\n",
      "In modern popular usage, an Epicurean is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures; Epicureanism implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink.\n",
      "Because Epicureanism posits that pleasure is the ultimate good ( telos ), it has been commonly misunderstood since ancient times as a doctrine that advocates the partaking in fleeting pleasures such as sexual excess and decadent food. This is not the case. Epicurus regarded ataraxia (tranquility, freedom from fear) and aponia (absence of pain) as the height of happiness. He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia. [ 41 ] Epicurus preferred \"the good\", and \"even wisdom and culture\", to the \"pleasure of the stomach\". [ 101 ]\n",
      "While Epicurus sought moderation at meals, he was also not averse to moderation in moderation, that is, to occasional luxury. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Called \"The Garden\" for being based in what would have been a kitchen garden, his community also became known for its Eikas (Greek εἰκάς from εἴκοσῐ eíkosi , \"twenty\"), [ 104 ] feasts of the twentieth (of the Greek month), [ 105 ] which was otherwise considered sacred to the god Apollo , and also corresponding to the final day of the rites of initiation to the mysteries of Demeter .
