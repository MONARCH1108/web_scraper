      "The Cyrenaics or Kyrenaics ( Ancient Greek : Κυρηναϊκοί , romanized : Kyrēnaïkoí ), were a sensual hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BCE , supposedly by Aristippus of Cyrene , although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name, Aristippus the Younger . The school was so called after Cyrene , the birthplace of Aristippus. It was one of the earliest Socratic schools. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain (as it did for Epicurus ), but positively enjoyable sensations. Of these, momentary pleasures, especially physical ones, are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. Further, they recognized the value of social obligation and that pleasure could be gained from altruistic behaviour. The school died out within a century and was replaced by the philosophy of Epicureanism .\n",
      "The history of the Cyrenaic school begins with Aristippus of Cyrene, who was born around 435 BCE. He came to Athens as a young man and became a pupil of Socrates . We have only limited knowledge of his movements after the execution of Socrates in 399 BCE, although he is said to have lived for a time in the court of Dionysius of Syracuse .\n",
      "It is uncertain precisely which doctrines ascribed to the Cyrenaic school were formulated by Aristippus. [ 1 ] Diogenes Laërtius , based on the authority of Sotion and Panaetius , provided a long list of books said to have been written by Aristippus. However, Diogenes also wrote that Sosicrates had stated that Aristippus had written nothing. [ 2 ] Among Aristippus' pupils was his daughter, Arete of Cyrene , and among her pupils was her son Aristippus the Younger . It was he, according to Aristocles , [ 3 ] who created a comprehensive system. [ 4 ] At the least, however, it can be said that the foundations of Cyrenaic philosophy were ideas originated by the elder Aristippus, [ 5 ] refined by Arete, and then further refined by Aristippus the Younger.\n",
      "After the time of the younger Aristippus, the school broke up into different factions, represented by Anniceris , Hegesias , and Theodorus , who all developed rival interpretations of Cyrenaic doctrines, many of which were responses to the new system of hedonistic philosophy laid down by Epicurus . [ 6 ] By the middle of the 3rd century BC, the Cyrenaic school was obsolete; Epicureanism had largely displaced its Cyrenaic rivals. [ 7 ]\n",
      "The Cyrenaics were hedonists and held that pleasure was the supreme good in life, especially physical pleasure, which they thought more intense and more desirable than mental pleasures. [ 8 ] Pleasure is the only good in life and pain is the only evil. Socrates had held that virtue was the only human good, but he had also accepted a limited role for its utilitarian side, allowing pleasure to be a secondary goal of moral action. [ 5 ] [ 9 ] Aristippus and his followers seized upon this, and made pleasure the sole final goal of life, denying that virtue had any intrinsic value.\n",
      "The Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical theory of knowledge . They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth . [ 10 ] They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate sense-experiences (for instance, that I am having a sweet sensation now) but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations (for instance, that the honey is sweet). [ 5 ] They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like. [ 11 ]\n",
      "All knowledge is of one's own immediate sensation. These sensations are motions which are purely subjective, and are painful, indifferent or pleasant, according as they are violent, tranquil or gentle. [ 5 ] [ 12 ] Further they are entirely individual, and can in no way be described as being of the world objectively. Feeling, therefore, is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct. [ 5 ] Our ways of being affected are alone knowable. [ 13 ] Thus the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure.\n",
      "Cyrenaicism deduces a single, universal aim for all people which is pleasure. Furthermore, all feeling is momentary and homogeneous. It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind. [ 12 ] Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect; the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures, being more simple and more intense, were preferable. [ 8 ] Momentary pleasure, preferably of a physical kind, is the only good for humans. [ 14 ] When it comes to pain the Cyrenaics held the opinion that pain which occurs suddenly is more difficult to endure than pain that can be foreseen. [ 15 ]\n",
      "However some actions which give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life. [ 16 ] Regard should be paid to law and custom, because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own, violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others. [ 8 ] Likewise, friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide. [ 8 ] Thus the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behavior. Like many of the leading modern utilitarians , they combined with their psychological distrust of popular judgments of right and wrong, and their firm conviction that all such distinctions are based solely on law and convention, the equally unwavering principle that the wise person who would pursue pleasure logically must abstain from that which is usually thought wrong or unjust. This idea, which occupies a prominent position in systems like those of Jeremy Bentham , [ 12 ] Volney , and even William Paley , was clearly of prime importance to the Cyrenaics. [ 17 ]\n",
      "The later Cyrenaics, Anniceris , Hegesias , and Theodorus , all developed variations on the standard Cyrenaic doctrine. For Anniceris, pleasure is achieved through individual acts of gratification which are sought for the pleasure that they produce, [ 18 ] but Anniceris laid great emphasis on the love of family, country, friendship and gratitude, which provide pleasure even when they demand sacrifice. [ 19 ] Hegesias believed that eudaimonia is impossible to achieve, [ 18 ] and hence the goal of life becomes the avoidance of pain and sorrow. [ 16 ] Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery are all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain. [ 20 ] For Hegesias, Cyrenaic hedonism was simply the least irrational strategy for dealing with the pains of life. [ 18 ] For Theodorus, the goal of life is mental pleasure not bodily pleasure, [ 21 ] and he placed greater emphasis on the need for moderation and justice. [ 22 ] He was also famous for being an atheist . [ 21 ] To some extent these philosophers were all trying to meet the challenge laid down by Epicureanism . [ 7 ]\n",
      "The philosophy of the Cyrenaics around the time of Hegesias of Cyrene evolved in a way that has similarities with Pyrrhonism , Epicurianism and also Buddhism . [ 23 ] In fact, there are striking similarities with the tenets of Buddhism , [ 23 ] in particular the Four Noble Truths and the concept of Dukkha or \"suffering\". Coincidentally, the rulers of Cyrene around the time Hegesias flourished, the Ptolemaic king of Egypt Ptolemy II Philadelphus and from 276 BC the independent king Magas of Cyrene , are both claimed to have been recipients of Buddhist missionaries from the Indian king Ashoka according to the latter's Edicts . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] It is therefore sometimes thought that Hegesias may have been directly influenced by Buddhist teachings through contacts with the alleged missionaries sent to his rulers in the 3rd century BC. [ a ] [ 27 ]\n",
      "The Cyrenaic ideal was alien to Christianity, and, in general, subsequent thinkers found it an ideal of hopeless pessimism. Yet in much later times it has found expression in many ethical and literary works, and it is common also in other ancient non-Hellenic literature. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition , there are quatrains in the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and pessimistic verses in the book of Ecclesiastes which might have been uttered by Aristippus. So in Byron and Heine there is the same tendency to seek relief from the intellectual cul-de-sac in frankly aesthetic satisfaction. Thus Cyrenaicism did not entirely vanish with its absorption in Epicureanism. [ 17 ]\n"

      "Confucianism , also known as Ruism or Ru classicism , [ 1 ] is a system of thought and behavior originating in ancient China , and is variously described as a tradition, philosophy ( humanistic or rationalistic ), religion , theory of government, or way of life. [ 2 ] Confucianism developed from teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE), during a time that was later referred to as the Hundred Schools of Thought era. Confucius considered himself a transmitter of cultural values inherited from the Xia (c. 2070–1600 BCE), Shang (c. 1600–1046 BCE) and Western Zhou (c. 1046–771 BCE) dynasties. [ 3 ] Confucianism was suppressed during the Legalist and autocratic Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), but survived. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the \"proto-Taoist\" Huang–Lao as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism. [ 4 ]\n",
      "Confucianism regards principles contained in the Five Classics , the key tenets that should be followed to promote the harmony of the family and the society as a whole. A Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). In the late Tang, Confucianism further developed in response to the increasing influence of Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism . This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar-official class in the Song dynasty (960–1297). The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism. The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weaknesses . They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the \" Three Principles of the People \" with the establishment of the Republic of China , and then Maoism under the People's Republic of China . In the late twentieth century, the Confucian work ethic has been credited with the rise of the East Asian economy . [ 4 ]\n",
      "With particular emphasis on the importance of the family and social harmony , rather than on an otherworldly source of spiritual values, [ 5 ] the core of Confucianism is humanistic . [ 6 ] According to American philosopher Herbert Fingarette 's conceptualisation of Confucianism as a philosophical system which regards \"the secular as sacred \", [ 7 ] Confucianism transcends the dichotomy between religion and humanism, considering the ordinary activities of human life—and especially human relationships—as a manifestation of the sacred, [ 8 ] because they are the expression of humanity's moral nature ( 性 ; xìng ), which has a transcendent anchorage in tian ( 天 ; tiān ; 'heaven'). [ 9 ] While the Confucian concept of tian shares some similarities with the concept of a deity, it is primarily an impersonal absolute principle like the tao or the Brahman . Most scholars [ 10 ] and practitioners do not think of tian as a god, and the deities that many Confucians worship do not originate from orthodox Confucianism. [ 11 ] Confucianism focuses on the practical order that is given by a this-worldly awareness of tian . [ 12 ]\n",
      "The worldly concern of Confucianism rests upon the belief that human beings are fundamentally good, and teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor, especially self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucian thought focuses on the cultivation of virtue in a morally organised world. [ 13 ] Some of the basic Confucian ethical concepts and practices include ren , yi , li , and zhi . Ren is the essence of the human being which manifests as compassion. It is the virtue-form of Heaven. [ 14 ] Yi is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good. Li is a system of ritual norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life in harmony with the law of Heaven. Zhi ( 智 ; zhì ) is the ability to see what is right and fair, or the converse, in the behaviors exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt, either passively or actively, for failure to uphold the cardinal moral values of ren and yi .\n",
      "Traditionally, cultures and countries in the Chinese cultural sphere are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including China , Taiwan , Korea , Japan , and Vietnam , as well as various territories settled predominantly by Han Chinese people , such as Singapore . Today, it has been credited for shaping East Asian societies and overseas Chinese communities , and to some extent, other parts of Asia. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Most Confucianist movements have had significant differences from the original Zhou -era teachings, [ 17 ] and are typically much more complex because of their reliance on \"elaborate doctrine \" [ 18 ] and other factors such as traditions with long histories. In the past few decades, there have been talks of a \"Confucian Revival\" in the academic and the scholarly community, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] and there has been a grassroots proliferation of various types of Confucian churches . [ 21 ] In late 2015, many Confucian personalities formally established a national Confucian Church ( 孔圣会 ; 孔聖會 ; Kǒngshènghuì ) in China to unify the many Confucian congregations and civil society organisations.\n",
      "Strictly speaking, there is no term in Chinese which directly corresponds to \"Confucianism\". The closest catch-all term for things related to Confucianism is the word ru ( 儒 ; rú ). Its literal meanings in modern Chinese include 'scholar', 'learned', or 'refined man'. In Old Chinese the word had a distinct set of meanings, including 'to tame', 'to mould', 'to educate', and 'to refine'. [ 23 ] : 190–197 Several different terms, some of which with modern origin, are used in different situations to express different facets of Confucianism, including:\n",
      "Three of them use ru . These names do not use the name \"Confucius\" at all, but instead focus on the ideal of the Confucian man. The use of the term \"Confucianism\" has been avoided by some modern scholars, who favor \"Ruism\" and \"Ruists\" instead. Robert Eno argues that the term has been \"burdened ... with the ambiguities and irrelevant traditional associations\". Ruism, as he states, is more faithful to the original Chinese name for the school. [ 23 ] : 7\n",
      "The term \"Traditionalist\" has been suggested by David Schaberg to emphasize the connection to the past, its standards, and inherited forms, in which Confucius himself placed so much importance. [ 24 ] This translation of the word ru is followed by e.g. Yuri Pines. [ 25 ]\n",
      "According to Zhou Youguang , ru originally referred to shamanic methods of holding rites and existed before Confucius's times, but with Confucius it came to mean devotion to propagating such teachings to bring civilisation to the people. Confucianism was initiated by the disciples of Confucius, developed by Mencius ( c. 372–289 BCE) and inherited by later generations, undergoing constant transformations and restructuring since its establishment, but preserving the principles of humaneness and righteousness at its core. [ 26 ]\n",
      "In the Western world, the character for water is often used as a symbol for Confucianism, which is not the case in modern China. [ citation needed ] However, the five phases were used as important symbols representing leadership in Han dynasty thought, including Confucianist works. [ 27 ]\n",
      "Traditionally, Confucius was thought to be the author or editor of the Five Classics which were the basic texts of Confucianism, all edited into their received versions around 500 years later by Imperial Librarian Liu Xin . [ 28 ] : 51 The scholar Yao Xinzhong allows that there are good reasons to believe that Confucian classics took shape in the hands of Confucius, but that \"nothing can be taken for granted in the matter of the early versions of the classics\". Yao suggests that most modern scholars hold the \"pragmatic\" view that Confucius and his followers did not intend to create a system of classics, but nonetheless \"contributed to their formation\". [ 29 ]\n",
      "The scholar Tu Weiming explains these classics as embodying \"five visions\" which underlie the development of Confucianism:\n",
      "Confucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the individual self and tian (\"heaven\"). To put it another way, it focuses on the relationship between humanity and heaven. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The principle or way of Heaven ( tian li or tian tao ) is the order of the world and the source of divine authority. [ 33 ] Tian li or tian tao is monistic , meaning that it is singular and indivisible. Individuals may realise their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of such order. [ 33 ] This transformation of the self may be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious community. [ 33 ] Joël Thoraval studied Confucianism as a diffused civil religion in contemporary China, finding that it expresses itself in the widespread worship of five cosmological entities: Heaven and Earth ( 地 ; dì ), the sovereign or the government ( 君 ; jūn ), ancestors ( 親 ; qīn ), and masters ( 師 ; shī ). [ 34 ]\n",
      "According to the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang , in Chinese cosmology, which is not merely Confucian but shared by many Chinese religions , \"the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy\" ( hundun and qi ), and is organized through the polarity of yin and yang that characterises any thing and life. Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not creation ex nihilo . \"Yin and yang are the invisible and visible, the receptive and the active, the unshaped and the shaped; they characterise the yearly cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (shady and bright), the sexes (female and male), and even sociopolitical history (disorder and order). Confucianism is concerned with finding \"middle ways\" between yin and yang at every new configuration of the world.\" [ 35 ]\n",
      "Confucianism conciliates both the inner and outer polarities of spiritual cultivation—that is to say self-cultivation and world redemption—synthesised in the ideal of \"sageliness within and kingliness without\". [ 33 ] Ren , translated as \"humaneness\" or the essence proper of a human being, is the character of compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time the means by which man may achieve oneness with Heaven comprehending his own origin in Heaven and therefore divine essence. In the Datong Shu [ zh ] , it is defined as \"to form one body with all things\" and \"when the self and others are not separated ... compassion is aroused\". [ 14 ]\n",
      "\"Lord Heaven\" and \" Jade Emperor \" were terms for a Confucianist supreme deity who was an anthropromorphized tian , [ 36 ] and some conceptions of it thought of the two names as synonymous.\n",
      "Tian , a key concept in Chinese thought, refers to the God of Heaven, the northern culmen of the skies and its spinning stars, [ 40 ] earthly nature and its laws which come from Heaven, to 'Heaven and Earth' (that is, \"all things\"), and to the awe-inspiring forces beyond human control. [ 44 ] There are so many uses in Chinese thought that it is impossible to give a single English translation. [ 45 ]\n",
      "Confucius used the term in a mystical way. [ 46 ] He wrote in the Analects (7.23) that tian gave him life, and that tian watched and judged (6.28; 9.12). In 9.5 Confucius says that a person may know the movements of tian , and this provides with the sense of having a special place in the universe. In 17.19 Confucius says that tian spoke to him, though not in words. The scholar Ronnie Littlejohn warns that tian was not to be interpreted as a personal God comparable to that of the Abrahamic faiths, in the sense of an otherworldly or transcendent creator. [ 47 ] Rather it is similar to what Taoists meant by Dao : \"the way things are\" or \"the regularities of the world\", [ 44 ] which Stephan Feuchtwang equates with the ancient Greek concept of physis , \"nature\" as the generation and regenerations of things and of the moral order. [ 48 ] Tian may also be compared to the Brahman of Hindu and Vedic traditions. [ 32 ] The scholar Promise Hsu, in the wake of Robert B. Louden, explained 17:19 (\"What does Tian ever say? Yet there are four seasons going round and there are the hundred things coming into being. What does Tian say?\") as implying that even though Tian is not a \"speaking person\", it constantly \"does\" through the rhythms of nature, and communicates \"how human beings ought to live and act\", at least to those who have learnt to carefully listen to it. [ 46 ]\n",
      "Duanmu Ci , a disciple of Confucius, said that Tian had set the master on the path to become a wise man (9.6). In 7.23 Confucius says that he has no doubt left that Tian gave him life, and from it he had developed right virtue ( de ). In 8.19, he says that the lives of the sages are interwoven with Tian . [ 45 ]\n",
      "Regarding personal gods ( shen , energies who emanate from and reproduce Tian ) enliving nature, in the Analects Confucius says that it is appropriate ( yi ) for people to worship ( 敬 ; jìng ) them, [ 49 ] although only through proper rites ( li ), implying respect of positions and discretion. [ 49 ] Confucius himself was a ritual and sacrificial master. [ 50 ]\n",
      "Answering to a disciple who asked whether it is better to sacrifice to the god of the stove or to the god of the family (a popular saying), in 3.13 Confucius says that in order to appropriately pray to gods, one should first know and respect Heaven. In 3.12, he explains that religious rituals produce meaningful experiences, [ 51 ] and one has to offer sacrifices in person, acting in presence, otherwise \"it is the same as not having sacrificed at all\". Rites and sacrifices to the gods have an ethical importance: they generate good life, because taking part in them leads to the overcoming of the self. [ 52 ] Analects 10.11 tells that Confucius always took a small part of his food and placed it on the sacrificial bowls as an offering to his ancestors . [ 50 ]\n",
      "Some Confucian movements worship Confucius, [ 53 ] although not as a supreme being or anything else approaching the power of tian or the tao , and/or gods from Chinese folk religion . These movements are not a part of mainstream Confucianism, although the boundary between Chinese folk religion and Confucianism can be blurred. [ citation needed ]\n",
      "Other movements, such as Mohism which was later absorbed by Taoism, developed a more theistic idea of Heaven. [ 54 ] Feuchtwang explains that the difference between Confucianism and Taoism primarily lies in the fact that the former focuses on the realisation of the starry order of Heaven in human society, while the latter on the contemplation of the Dao which spontaneously arises in nature. [ 48 ] However, Confucianism does venerate many aspects of nature [ 16 ] and also respects various tao , [ 55 ] as well as what Confucius saw as the main tao , the \"[Way] of Heaven.\" [ 13 ]\n",
      "The Way of Heaven involves \"lifelong and sincere devotion to traditional cultural forms\" and wu wei , \"a state of spontaneous harmony between individual inclinations and the sacred Way\". [ 13 ]\n",
      "Kelly James Clark argued that Confucius himself saw Tian as an anthropomorphic god that Clark hypothetically refers to as \"Heavenly Supreme Emperor\", although most other scholars on Confucianism disagree with this view. [ 56 ]\n",
      "As explained by Stephan Feuchtwang, the order coming from Heaven preserves the world, and has to be followed by humanity finding a \"middle way\" between yin and yang forces in each new configuration of reality. Social harmony or morality is identified as patriarchy, which is expressed in the worship of ancestors and deified progenitors in the male line, at ancestral shrines . [ 48 ]\n",
      "Confucian ethical codes are described as humanistic. [ 6 ] They may be practiced by all the members of a society. Confucian ethics is characterised by the promotion of virtues, encompassed by the Five Constants, elaborated by Confucian scholars out of the inherited tradition during the Han dynasty . [ 57 ] The Five Constants are: [ 57 ]\n",
      "These are accompanied by the classical four virtues ( 四字 ; sìzì ), one of which ( Yi ) is also included among the Five Constants:\n",
      "There are many other traditionally Confucian values, such as 'honesty' ( 诚 ; chéng ), 'bravery' ( 勇 ; yǒng ), 'incorruptibility' ( 廉 ; lián ), 'kindness', ' forgiveness' ( 恕 ; shù ), a 'sense of right and wrong' ( 耻 ; chǐ ), 'gentleness' ( 温 ; wēn ), 'kindheartenedness' ( 良 ; liáng ), 'respect' ( 恭 ; gōng ), 'frugality' ( 俭 ; jiǎn ), and 让 ; ràng ; 'modesty').\n",
      "Ren (仁 ) is the Confucian virtue denoting the good feeling a virtuous human experiences when being altruistic . Internally ren can mean \"to look up\" meaning \"to aspire to higher Heavenly principles or ideals\",  It is exemplified by a normal adult's protective feelings for children. It is considered the essence of the human being, endowed by Heaven, and at the same time the means by which someone may act according to the principle of Heaven and become one with it. [ 14 ]\n",
      "Yan Hui , Confucius's most outstanding student, once asked his master to describe the rules of ren and Confucius replied, \"one should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing improper, do nothing improper.\" [ 58 ] Confucius also defined ren in the following way: \"wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.\" [ 59 ]\n",
      "Another meaning of ren is \"not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself.\" [ 60 ] Confucius also said, \" ren is not far off; he who seeks it has already found it.\" Ren is close to man and never leaves him.\n",
      "Li ( 礼 ; 禮 ) is a word which finds its most extensive use in Confucian and post-Confucian Chinese philosophy . Li is variously translated as ' rite ' or ' reason ', 'ratio' in the pure sense of Vedic ṛta ('right', 'order') when referring to the cosmic law, but when referring to its realisation in the context of human social behaviour it has also been translated as ' customs ', 'measures' and 'rules', among other terms. Li also means religious rites which establish relations between humanity and the gods.\n",
      "According to Stephan Feuchtwang, rites are conceived as \"what makes the invisible visible\", making possible for humans to cultivate the underlying order of nature. Correctly performed rituals move society in alignment with earthly and heavenly (astral) forces, establishing the harmony of the three realms—Heaven, Earth and humanity. This practice is defined as \"centering\" ( 央 ; yāng or 中 ; zhōng ). Among all things of creation, humans themselves are \"central\" because they have the ability to cultivate and centre natural forces. [ 61 ]\n",
      "Li embodies the entire web of interaction between humanity, human objects, and nature. Confucius includes in his discussions of li such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. Xunzi cites \"songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation ... rice and millet, fish and meat ... the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes ... spacious rooms and secluded halls, soft mats, couches and benches\" as vital parts of the fabric of li .\n",
      "Confucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of li . Some Confucians proposed that all human beings may pursue perfection by learning and practising li . Overall, Confucians believe that governments should place more emphasis on li and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern.\n",
      "Loyalty ( 忠 ; zhōng ) is particularly relevant for the social class to which most of Confucius's students belonged, because the most important way for an ambitious young scholar to become a prominent official was to enter a ruler's civil service.\n",
      "Confucius himself did not propose that \"might makes right\", but rather that a superior should be obeyed because of his moral rectitude. In addition, loyalty does not mean subservience to authority. This is because reciprocity is demanded from the superior as well. As Confucius stated \"a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness (loyalty).\" [ 62 ]\n",
      "Similarly, Mencius also said that \"when the prince regards his ministers as his hands and feet, his ministers regard their prince as their belly and heart; when he regards them as his dogs and horses, they regard him as another man; when he regards them as the ground or as grass, they regard him as a robber and an enemy.\" [ 63 ] Moreover, Mencius indicated that if the ruler is incompetent, he should be replaced. If the ruler is evil, then the people have the right to overthrow him. [ 64 ] A good Confucian is also expected to remonstrate with his superiors when necessary. [ 65 ] At the same time, a proper Confucian ruler should also accept his ministers' advice, as this will help him govern the realm better.\n",
      "In later ages, however, emphasis was often placed more on the obligations of the ruled to the ruler, and less on the ruler's obligations to the ruled. Like filial piety, loyalty was often subverted by the autocratic regimes in China. Nonetheless, throughout the ages, many Confucians continued to fight against unrighteous superiors and rulers. Many of these Confucians suffered and sometimes died because of their conviction and action. [ 66 ] During the Ming-Qing era, prominent Confucians such as Wang Yangming promoted individuality and independent thinking as a counterweight to subservience to authority. [ 67 ] The famous thinker Huang Zongxi also strongly criticised the autocratic nature of the imperial system and wanted to keep imperial power in check. [ 68 ]\n",
      "Many Confucians also realised that loyalty and filial piety have the potential of coming into conflict with one another. This may be true especially in times of social chaos, such as during the period of the Ming-Qing transition . [ 69 ]\n",
      "In Confucian philosophy, \"filial piety\" ( 孝 ; xiào ) is a virtue of respect for one's parents and ancestors, and of the hierarchies within society: father–son, elder–junior and male–female. [ 48 ] The Confucian classic Xiaojing (\"Book of Piety\"), thought to be written during the Qin or Han dynasties, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of xiao . The book, a conversation between Confucius and his disciple Zeng Shen , is about how to set up a good society using the principle of xiao . [ 70 ]\n",
      "In more general terms, filial piety means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be rebellious; show love, respect and support; the wife in filial piety must obey her husband absolutely and take care of the whole family wholeheartedly. display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness, for blindly following the parents' wishes is not considered to be xiao ; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out sacrifices after their death.\n",
      "Filial piety is considered a key virtue in Chinese culture, and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is \" The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars \". These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese believers. [ 71 ]\n",
      "Social harmony results in part from every individual knowing his or her place in the natural order, and playing his or her part well. Reciprocity or responsibility ( renqing ) extends beyond filial piety and involves the entire network of social relations, even the respect for rulers. [ 48 ] This is shown in the story where Duke Jing of Qi asks Confucius about government, by which he meant proper administration so as to bring social harmony:\n",
      "齊景公問政於孔子。孔子對曰：君君，臣臣，父父，子子。 The duke Jing, of Qi , asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\"\n",
      "Particular duties arise from one's particular situation in relation to others. The individual stands simultaneously in several different relationships with different people: as a junior in relation to parents and elders, and as a senior in relation to younger siblings, students, and others. While juniors are considered in Confucianism to owe their seniors reverence, seniors also have duties of benevolence and concern toward juniors. The same is true with the husband and wife relationship where the husband needs to show benevolence towards his wife and the wife needs to respect the husband in return. This theme of mutuality still exists in East Asian cultures even to this day.\n",
      "The Five Bonds are: ruler to ruled, father to son, husband to wife, elder brother to younger brother, friend to friend. Specific duties were prescribed to each of the participants in these sets of relationships. Such duties are also extended to the dead, where the living stand as sons to their deceased family. The only relationship where respect for elders is not stressed was the friend to friend relationship, where mutual equal respect is emphasised instead. All these duties take the practical form of prescribed rituals, for instance wedding and death rituals. [ 48 ]\n",
      "The junzi ('lord's son') is a Chinese philosophical term often translated as \" gentleman \" or \"superior person\" [ 72 ] and employed by Confucius in the Analects to describe the ideal man.\n",
      "In Confucianism, the sage or wise is the ideal personality; however, it is very hard to become one of them. Confucius created the model of junzi , gentleman, which may be achieved by any individual. Later, Zhu Xi defined junzi as second only to the sage. There are many characteristics of the junzi : he may live in poverty, he does more and speaks less, he is loyal, obedient and knowledgeable. The junzi disciplines himself. Ren is fundamental to become a junzi . [ 73 ]\n",
      "As the potential leader of a nation, a son of the ruler is raised to have a superior ethical and moral position while gaining inner peace through his virtue. To Confucius, the junzi sustained the functions of government and social stratification through his ethical values. Despite its literal meaning, any righteous man willing to improve himself may become a junzi .\n",
      "In contrast to the junzi , the xiaoren ( 小人 ; xiăorén , \"small or petty person\") does not grasp the value of virtues and seeks only immediate gains. The petty person is egotistic and does not consider the consequences of his action in the overall scheme of things. Should the ruler be surrounded by xiaoren as opposed to junzi , his governance and his people will suffer due to their small-mindness. Examples of such xiaoren individuals may range from those who continually indulge in sensual and emotional pleasures all day to the politician who is interested merely in power and fame; neither sincerely aims for the long-term benefit of others.\n",
      "The junzi enforces his rule over his subjects by acting virtuously himself. It is thought that his pure virtue would lead others to follow his example. The ultimate goal is that the government behaves much like a family, the junzi being a beacon of filial piety.\n",
      "Confucius believed that social disorder often stemmed from failure to perceive, understand, and deal with reality. Fundamentally, then, social disorder may stem from the failure to call things by their proper names, and his solution to this was the \"rectification of names\" ( 正名 ; zhèngmíng ). He gave an explanation of this concept to one of his disciples:\n",
      "Zi-lu said, \"The vassal of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\" The Master replied, \"What is necessary to rectify names.\" \"So! indeed!\" said Zi-lu. \"You are wide off the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\" The Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! The superior man [Junzi] cannot care about the everything, just as he cannot go to check all himself! If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" ( Analects XIII, 3, tr. Legge)\n",
      "Xunzi chapter (22) \"On the Rectification of Names\" claims the ancient sage-kings chose names ( 名 ; míng ) that directly corresponded with actualities ( 實 ; shí ), but later generations confused terminology, coined new nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong. Since social harmony is of utmost importance, without the proper rectification of names, society would essentially crumble and \"undertakings [would] not [be] completed.\" [ 74 ]\n",
      "According to He Guanghu , Confucianism may be identified as a continuation of the Shang - Zhou ( c. 1600 –256 BCE) official religion, or the Chinese aboriginal religion which has lasted uninterrupted for three thousand years. [ 76 ] Both the dynasties worshipped a supreme \"godhead\", called Shangdi ('Highest Deity') or Di by the Shang and Tian ('Heaven') by the Zhou. Shangdi was conceived as the first ancestor of the Shang royal house, [ 77 ] an alternate name for him being the \"Supreme Progenitor\" ( 上甲 ; Shàngjiǎ ). [ 78 ] Shang theology viewed the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors as parts of Di . Di manifests as the Wufang Shangdi with the winds ( 風 ; fēng ) as its cosmic will. [ 79 ] With the Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, the name for the supreme godhead became tian . [ 77 ] While the Shang identified Shangdi as their ancestor-god to assert their claim to power by divine right, the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the Mandate of Heaven . In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian . [ 3 ]\n",
      "John C. Didier and David Pankenier relate the shapes of both the ancient Chinese characters for Di and Tian to the patterns of stars in the northern skies, either drawn, in Didier's theory by connecting the constellations bracketing the north celestial pole as a square, [ 80 ] or in Pankenier's theory by connecting some of the stars which form the constellations of the Big Dipper and broader Ursa Major , and Ursa Minor (Little Dipper). [ 81 ] Cultures in other parts of the world have also conceived these stars or constellations as symbols of the origin of things, the supreme godhead, divinity and royal power. [ 82 ] The supreme godhead was also identified with the dragon , symbol of unlimited power ( qi ), [ 77 ] of the protean primordial power which embodies both yin and yang in unity, associated to the constellation Draco which winds around the north ecliptic pole , [ 75 ] and slithers between the Little and Big Dipper.\n",
      "By the 6th century BCE, the power of Tian and the symbols that represented it on earth (architecture of cities, temples, altars and ritual vessels , and the Zhou system of rites) became \"diffuse\" and claimed by different potentates in the Zhou states to legitimise economic, political, and military ambitions. Communication with the divine no longer was an exclusive privilege of the Zhou royal house, but might be bought by anyone able to afford the elaborate ceremonies and the old and new rites required to access the authority of Tian . [ 83 ]\n",
      "Besides the waning Zhou ritual system, what may be defined as 'wild' ( 野 ; yě ) traditions, or traditions outside of the official system, developed as attempts to access the will of Tian . As central political authority crumbled in the wake of the collapse of the Western Zhou , the population lost faith in the official tradition, which was no longer perceived as an effective way to communicate with Heaven. The traditions of the 'Nine Fields' ( 九野 ) and of the Yijing flourished. [ 84 ] Chinese thinkers, faced with this challenge to legitimacy, diverged in a \" Hundred Schools of Thought \", each positing its own philosophical lens for understanding the processes of the world.\n",
      "Confucius (551–479 BCE) appeared in this period of political reconfiguration and spiritual questioning. He was educated in Shang–Zhou traditions, which he contributed to transmit and reformulate giving centrality to self-cultivation and agency of humans, [ 3 ] and the educational power of the self-established individual in assisting others to establish themselves (the 愛人 ; àirén ; 'principle of loving others'). [ 85 ] As the Zhou reign collapsed, traditional values were abandoned resulting in a period of perceived moral decline. Confucius saw an opportunity to reinforce values of compassion and tradition into society, with the intended goal of reconstructing what he believed to be a lost perfect moral order of high antiquity. Disillusioned with the culture, opposing scholars, and religious authorities of the time, he began to advance an ethical interpretation of traditional Zhou religion. [ 13 ] In his view, the power of Tian is pervasive, and responds positively to the sincere heart driven by humaneness and rightness, decency and altruism. Confucius conceived these qualities as the foundation needed to restore socio-political harmony. Like many contemporaries, Confucius saw ritual practices as efficacious ways to access Tian , but he thought that the crucial knot was the reverent inner state that participants enter prior to engaging in the ritual acts. [ 86 ] Confucius is said to have amended and recodified the classical books inherited from the Xia-Shang-Zhou dynasties, and to have composed the Spring and Autumn Annals . [ 26 ]\n",
      "Philosophers in the Warring States period , both focused on state-endorsed ritual and non-aligned to state ritual built upon Confucius's legacy, compiled in the Analects , and formulated the classical metaphysics that became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with Confucius, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian , or 'the One' ( 一 ; Yī ), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. They also extended the theory, proposing the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through correct state of mind. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter. [ 87 ]\n",
      "In the Han dynasty, Confucians beginning with Dong Zhongshu synthesised Warring States Confucianism with ideas of yin and yang , and wuxing , as well as folk superstition and the prior schools that led up to the School of Naturalists . [ 88 ]\n",
      "In the 460s , Confucianism competed with Chinese Buddhism and \"traditional Confucianism\" was \"a broad cosmology that was as much about personal ethics as about spiritual beliefs\" and had roots that went back to Confucianist philosophers from over a thousand years before. [ 89 ]\n",
      "The Confucian examination system was abolished in Korea in 1894, in China in 1905, and in Vietnam in 1919. This meant that conformity to Confucian ideology was no longer a prerequisite for a career in the civil service or politics, allowing persons of other ideologies (notably Nationalism and Socialism) to attain leading positions in society. [ 90 ]\n",
      "Since the 2000s, there has been a growing identification of the Chinese intellectual class with Confucianism. [ 91 ] In 2003, the Confucian intellectual Kang Xiaoguang published a manifesto in which he made four suggestions: Confucian education should enter official education at any level, from elementary to high school; the state should establish Confucianism as the state religion by law; Confucian religion should enter the daily life of ordinary people through standardisation and development of doctrines, rituals, organisations, churches and activity sites; the Confucian religion should be spread through non-governmental organisations. [ 91 ] Another modern proponent of the institutionalisation of Confucianism in a state church is Jiang Qing . [ 92 ]\n",
      "In 2005, the Center for the Study of Confucian Religion was established, [ 91 ] and guoxue started to be implemented in public schools on all levels. Being well received by the population, even Confucian preachers have appeared on television since 2006. [ 91 ] The most enthusiastic New Confucians proclaim the uniqueness and superiority of Confucian Chinese culture, and have generated some popular sentiment against Western cultural influences in China. [ 91 ]\n",
      "The idea of a \" Confucian church \" as the state religion of China has roots in the thought of Kang Youwei , an exponent of the early New Confucian search for a regeneration of the social relevance of Confucianism, at a time when it was de-institutionalised with the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the Chinese empire. [ 93 ] Kang modeled his ideal \"Confucian Church\" after European national Christian churches, as a hierarchic and centralised institution, closely bound to the state, with local church branches, devoted to the worship and the spread of the teachings of Confucius. [ 93 ]\n",
      "In contemporary China, the Confucian revival has developed into various interwoven directions: the proliferation of Confucian schools or academies , [ 92 ] the resurgence of Confucian rites , [ 92 ] and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the popular level, such as the Confucian communities ( 社區儒學 ; shèqū rúxué ). Some scholars also consider the reconstruction of lineage churches and their ancestral temples , as well as cults and temples of natural and national gods within broader Chinese traditional religion, as part of the renewal of Confucianism. [ 94 ]\n",
      "Other forms of revival are salvationist folk religious movements [ 95 ] groups with a specifically Confucian focus, or Confucian churches , for example the Yīdān xuétáng ( 一耽學堂 ) of Beijing , [ 96 ] the Mèngmǔtáng ( 孟母堂 ) of Shanghai , [ 97 ] Confucian Shenism (also known as the \"phoenix churches\"), [ 98 ] the Confucian Fellowship ( 儒教道壇 ; Rújiào Dàotán ) in northern Fujian which has spread rapidly over the years after its foundation, [ 98 ] and ancestral temples of the Kong kin (the lineage of the descendants of Confucius himself) operating as Confucian-teaching churches. [ 97 ]\n",
      "Also, the Hong Kong Confucian Academy, one of the direct heirs of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, has expanded its activities to the mainland, with the construction of statues of Confucius, Confucian hospitals, restoration of temples and other activities. [ 99 ] In 2009, Zhou Beichen founded another institution which inherits the idea of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, the Holy Hall of Confucius ( 孔聖堂 ; Kǒngshèngtáng ) in Shenzhen , affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of Qufu City. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] It was the first of a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 in the Holy Confucian Church . The first spiritual leader of the church is the scholar Jiang Qing , the founder and manager of the Yangming Confucian Abode ( 陽明精舍 ; Yángmíng jīngshě ), a Confucian academy in Guiyang , Guizhou .\n",
      "Chinese folk religious temples and kinship ancestral shrines may, on peculiar occasions, choose Confucian liturgy (called 儒 ; rú or 正統 ( zhèngtǒng ; ' orthopraxy ') led by Confucian ritual masters ( 禮生 ; lǐshēng ) to worship the gods, instead of Taoist or popular ritual. [ 102 ] \"Confucian businessmen\" ( 儒商人 ; rúshāngrén , also \"refined businessman\") is a recently \"rediscovered\" concept defining people of the economic-entrepreneurial elite who recognise their social responsibility and therefore apply Confucian culture to their business. [ 103 ]\n",
      "Confucianists historically tried to proselytize to others, [ 104 ] although this is rarely done in modern times. Given Confucianism's place of importance in historical Chinese governments, the argument has been made that Imperial China's wars were Confucianism's wars, but the connection between Confucianism and war is not so direct or simple. [ 105 ] Modern Confucianism is the descendant of movements that greatly changed how they practiced the teachings of Confucius and his disciples from previous orthodox teachings. [ 17 ]\n",
      "子曰：為政以德，譬如北辰，居其所而眾星共之。 The Master said, \"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\"\n",
      "A key Confucian concept is that in order to govern others one must first govern oneself according to the universal order. When actual, the king's personal virtue ( de ) spreads beneficent influence throughout the kingdom. This idea is developed further in the Great Learning and is tightly linked with the Taoist concept of wu wei : the less the king does, the more gets done. By being the \"calm center\" around which the kingdom turns, the king allows everything to function smoothly and avoids having to tamper with the individual parts of the whole.\n",
      "This idea may be traced back to the ancient shamanic beliefs of the king being the axle between the sky, human beings, and the Earth. [ citation needed ] The emperors of China were considered agents of Heaven, endowed with the Mandate of Heaven , [ 106 ] one of the most vital concepts in imperial-era political theory. Some Confucianists believed they held the power to define the hierarchy of divinities, by bestowing titles upon mountains, rivers and dead people, acknowledging them as powerful and therefore establishing their cults. [ 107 ]\n",
      "Confucianism, despite supporting the importance of obeying national authority, places this obedience under absolute moral principles that curbed the willful exercise of power, rather than being unconditional. Submission to authority was only taken within the context of the moral obligations that rulers had toward their subjects, in particular ren . Confucians—including the most pro-authoritarian scholars such as Xunzi —have always recognised the right of revolution against tyranny. [ 108 ]\n",
      "子曰：有教無類。 The Master said: \"In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes.\"\n",
      "Although Confucius claimed that he never invented anything but was only transmitting ancient knowledge ( Analects 7.1 ), he did produce a number of new ideas. Many European and American admirers such as Voltaire and Herrlee G. Creel point to the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with nobility of virtue. [ 109 ] Junzi ('lord's son'), which originally signified the younger, non-inheriting, offspring of a noble, became, in Confucius's work, an epithet having much the same meaning and evolution as the English \"gentleman\".\n",
      "A virtuous commoner who cultivates his qualities may be a \"gentleman\", while a shameless son of the king is only a \"petty person\". That Confucius admitted students of different classes as disciples is a clear demonstration that he fought against the feudal structures that defined pre-imperial Chinese society. [ 110 ] [ page needed ]\n",
      "Another new idea, that of meritocracy , led to the introduction of the imperial examination system in China. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position which would bring wealth and honour to the whole family. The Chinese imperial examination system started in the Sui dynasty . Over the following centuries the system grew until finally almost anyone who wished to become an official had to prove his worth by passing a set of written government examinations. [ 111 ]\n",
      "Confucian political meritocracy is not merely a historical phenomenon. The practice of meritocracy still exists across China and East Asia today, and a wide range of contemporary intellectuals—from Daniel Bell to Tongdong Bai, Joseph Chan, and Jiang Qing —defend political meritocracy as a viable alternative to liberal democracy. [ 112 ]\n",
      "In Just Hierarchy , Daniel Bell and Wang Pei argue that hierarchies are inevitable. [ 113 ] Faced with ever-increasing complexity at scale, modern societies must build hierarchies to coordinate collective action and tackle long-term problems such as climate change. In this context, people need not—and should not—want to flatten hierarchies as much as possible. They ought to ask what makes political hierarchies just and use these criteria to decide the institutions that deserve preservation, those that require reform, and those that need radical transformation. They call this approach \"progressive conservatism\", a term that reflects the ambiguous place of the Confucian tradition within the Left-Right dichotomy. [ 113 ] : 8–21\n",
      "Bell and Wang propose two justifications for political hierarchies that do not depend on a \"one person, one vote\" system. First is raw efficiency, which may require centralized rule in the hands of the competent few. Second, and most important, is serving the interests of the people (and the common good more broadly). [ 113 ] : 66–93 In Against Political Equality , Tongdong Bai complements this account by using a proto-Rawlsian \"political difference principle\". Just as Rawls claims that economic inequality is justified so long as it benefits those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, so Bai argues that political inequality is justified so long as it benefits those materially worse off. [ 114 ] : 102–106\n",
      "Bell, Wang, and Bai all criticize liberal democracy to argue that government by the people may not be government for the people in any meaningful sense of the term. They argue that voters tend to act in irrational, tribal, short-termist ways; they are vulnerable to populism and struggle to account for the interests of future generations. In other words, at a minimum, democracy needs Confucian meritocratic checks. [ 114 ] : 32–47\n",
      "In The China Model , Bell argues that Confucian political meritocracy provides—and has provided—a blueprint for China's development. [ 115 ] For Bell, the ideal according to which China should reform itself (and has reformed itself) follows a simple structure: Aspiring rulers first pass hyper-selective examinations, then have to rule well at the local level to be promoted to positions as the provincial level, then have to excel at the provincial level to access positions at the national level, and so on. [ 115 ] : 151–179 This system aligns with what Harvard historian James Hankins calls \"virtue politics\", or the idea that institutions should be built to select the most competent and virtuous rulers—as opposed to institutions concerned first and foremost with limiting the power of rulers. [ 116 ]\n",
      "While contemporary defenders of Confucian political meritocracy all accept this broad frame, they disagree with each other on three main questions: institutional design, the means by which meritocrats are promoted, and the compatibility of Confucian political meritocracy with liberalism.\n",
      "Bell and Wang favour a system in which officials at the local level are democratically elected and higher-level officials are promoted by peers. [ 113 ] : 66–93 As Bell puts it, he defends \"democracy at the bottom, experimentation in the middle, and meritocracy at the top.\" [ 115 ] : 151–179 Bell and Wang argue that this combination conserves the main advantages of democracy—involving the people in public affairs at the local level, strengthening the legitimacy of the system, forcing some degree of direct accountability, etc.—while preserving the broader meritocratic character of the regime.\n",
      "Jiang Qing, by contrast, imagines a tricameral government with one chamber selected by the people (the 庶民院 ; 'House of the Commoners'), one chamber composed of Confucian meritocrats selected via examination and gradual promotion (the 通儒院 ; 'House of Confucian Tradition'), and one body made up of descendants of Confucius himself (the 國體院 ; 'House of National Essence'). [ 117 ] Jiang's aim is to construct a legitimacy that will go beyond what he sees as the atomistic, individualist, and utilitarian ethos of modern democracies and ground authority in something sacred and traditional. While Jiang's model is closer to an ideal theory than Bell's proposals, it represents a more traditionalist alternative.\n",
      "Tongdong Bai presents an in-between solution by proposing a two-tiered bicameral system. [ 114 ] : 52–110 At the local level, as with Bell, Bai advocates Deweyan participatory democracy. At the national level, Bai proposes two chambers: one of meritocrats (selected by examination, by examination and promotion, from leaders in certain professional fields, etc.), and one of representatives elected by the people. While the lower house does not have any legislative power per se, it acts as a popular accountability mechanism by championing the people and putting pressure on the upper house. More generally, Bai argues that his model marries the best of meritocracy and democracy. Following Dewey's account of democracy as a way of life, he points to the participatory features of his local model: citizens still get to have a democratic lifestyle, participate in political affairs, and be educated as \"democratic men\". Similarly, the lower house allows citizens to be represented, have a voice in public affairs (albeit a weak one), and ensure accountability. Meanwhile, the meritocratic house preserves competence, statesmanship, and Confucian virtues.\n",
      "Defenders of Confucian political meritocracy generally champion a system in which rulers are selected on the basis of intellect, social skills, and virtue. Bell proposes a model wherein aspiring meritocrats take hyper-selective exams and prove themselves at the local levels of government before reaching the higher levels of government, where they hold more centralized power. [ 115 ] : 151–179 In his account, the exams select for intellect and other virtues—for instance, the ability to argue three different viewpoints on a contentious issue may indicate a certain degree of openness. [ 115 ] : 63–110 Tongdong Bai's approach incorporates different ways to select members of the meritocratic house, from exams to performance in various fields—business, science, administration, and so on. In every case, Confucian meritocrats draw on China's extensive history of meritocratic administration to outline the pros and cons of competing methods of selection. [ 114 ] : 67–97\n",
      "For those who, like Bell, defend a model in which performance at the local levels of government determines future promotion, an important question is how the system judges who \"performs best\". In other words, while examinations may ensure that early-career officials are competent and educated, how is it thereafter ensured that only those who rule well get promoted? The literature opposes those who prefer evaluation by peers to evaluation by superiors, with some thinkers including quasi-democratic selection mechanisms along the way. Bell and Wang favour a system in which officials at the local level are democratically elected and higher-level officials are promoted by peers. [ 113 ] : 84–106 Because they believe that promotion should depend upon peer evaluations only, Bell and Wang argue against transparency—i.e. the public should not know how officials are selected, since ordinary people are in no position to judge officials beyond the local level. [ 113 ] : 76–78 Others, like Jiang Qing, defend a model in which superiors decide who gets promoted; this method is in line with more traditionalist strands of Confucian political thought, which place a greater emphasis on strict hierarchies and epistemic paternalism—that is, the idea that older and more experienced people know more. [ 117 ] : 27–44\n",
      "Another key question is whether Confucian political thought is compatible with liberalism. Tongdong Bai, for instance, argues that while Confucian political thought departs from the \"one person, one vote\" model, it can conserve many of the essential characteristics of liberalism, such as freedom of speech and individual rights. [ 114 ] : 97–110 In fact, both Daniel Bell and Tongdong Bai hold that Confucian political meritocracy can tackle challenges that liberalism wants to tackle, but cannot by itself. At the cultural level, for instance, Confucianism, its institutions, and its rituals offer bulwarks against atomization and individualism. At the political level, the non-democratic side of political meritocracy is—for Bell and Bai—more efficient at addressing long-term questions such as climate change, in part because the meritocrats do not have to worry about the whims of public opinion. [ 115 ] : 14–63\n",
      "Joseph Chan defends the compatibility of Confucianism with both liberalism and democracy. In his book Confucian Perfectionism , he argues that Confucians can embrace both democracy and liberalism on instrumental grounds; that is, while liberal democracy may not be valuable for its own sake, its institutions remain valuable—particularly when combined with a broadly Confucian culture—to serve Confucian ends and inculcate Confucian virtues. [ 118 ]\n",
      "Other Confucians have criticized Confucian meritocrats like Bell for their rejection of democracy. For them, Confucianism does not have to be premised on the assumption that meritorious, virtuous political leadership is inherently incompatible with popular sovereignty, political equality and the right to political participation. [ 119 ] These thinkers accuse the meritocrats of overestimating the flaws of democracy, mistaking temporary flaws for permanent and inherent features, and underestimating the challenges that the construction of a true political meritocracy poses in practice—including those faced by contemporary China and Singapore. [ 120 ] Franz Mang claims that, when decoupled from democracy, meritocracy tends to deteriorate into an oppressive regime under putatively \"meritorious\" but actually \"authoritarian\" rulers; Mang accuses Bell's China model of being self-defeating, as—Mang claims—the CCP's authoritarian modes of engagement with the dissenting voices illustrate. [ 121 ] He Baogang and Mark Warren add that \"meritocracy\" should be understood as a concept describing a regime's character rather than its type, which is determined by distribution of political power—on their view, democratic institutions can be built which are meritocratic insofar as they favour competence.

      "Roy Tseng, drawing on the New Confucians of the twentieth century, argues that Confucianism and liberal democracy can enter into a dialectical process, in which liberal rights and voting rights are rethought into resolutely modern, but nonetheless Confucian ways of life. [ 123 ] This synthesis, blending Confucians rituals and institutions with a broader liberal democratic frame, is distinct from both Western-style liberalism—which, for Tseng, suffers from excessive individualism and a lack of moral vision—and from traditional Confucianism—which, for Tseng, has historically suffered from rigid hierarchies and sclerotic elites. Against defenders of political meritocracy, Tseng claims that the fusion of Confucian and democratic institutions can conserve the best of both worlds, producing a more communal democracy which draws on a rich ethical tradition, addresses abuses of power, and combines popular accountability with a clear attention to the cultivation of virtue in elites.\n",
      "The works of Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of Jesuit missionaries stationed in China . [ note 3 ] Matteo Ricci was among the very earliest to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and father Prospero Intorcetta wrote about the life and works of Confucius in Latin in 1687. [ 124 ]\n",
      "Translations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period, [ 125 ] particularly among the Deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into Western civilization . [ 124 ] [ 126 ]\n",
      "Confucianism influenced the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , who was attracted to the philosophy because of its perceived similarity to his own. It is postulated that certain elements of Leibniz's philosophy, such as \"simple substance\" and \" Pre-established harmony \", were borrowed from his interactions with Confucianism. [ 125 ]\n",
      "The French philosopher Voltaire , Leibniz's intellectual rival, was also influenced by Confucius, seeing the concept of Confucian rationalism as an alternative to Christian dogma. [ 127 ] He praised Confucian ethics and politics, portraying the sociopolitical hierarchy of China as a model for Europe: [ 127 ]\n",
      "Confucius has no interest in falsehood; he did not pretend to be prophet; he claimed no inspiration; he taught no new religion; he used no delusions; flattered not the emperor under whom he lived ...\n",
      "From the late 17th century onwards a whole body of literature known as the Han Kitab developed amongst the Hui Muslims of China who infused Islamic thought with Confucianism. Especially the works of Liu Zhi such as Tianfang Dianli ( 天方典禮 ; Tiānfāng Diǎnlǐ ) sought to harmonise Islam with not only Confucianism but also with Taoism and is considered to be one of the crowning achievements of the Chinese Islamic culture. [ 128 ]\n",
      "Important military and political figures in modern Chinese history continued to be influenced by Confucianism, like the Muslim warlord Ma Fuxiang . [ 129 ] The New Life Movement in the early 20th century was also influenced by Confucianism.\n",
      "Referred to variously as the Confucian hypothesis and as a debated component of the more all-encompassing Asian Development Model, there exists among political scientists and economists a theory that Confucianism plays a large latent role in the ostensibly non-Confucian cultures of modern-day East Asia, in the form of the rigorous work ethic it endowed those cultures with. These scholars have held that, if not for Confucianism's influence on these cultures, many of the people of the East Asia region would not have been able to modernise and industrialise as quickly as Singapore , Malaysia , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Japan , South Korea and even China have done.\n",
      "For example, the impact of the Vietnam War on Vietnam was devastating, but over the last few decades Vietnam has been re-developing in a very fast pace. Most scholars attribute the origins of this idea to futurologist Herman Kahn 's World Economic Development: 1979 and Beyond . [ 130 ]\n",
      "Other studies, for example Cristobal Kay's Why East Asia Overtook Latin America: Agrarian Reform, Industrialization, and Development , have attributed the Asian growth to other factors, for example the character of agrarian reforms, \"state-craft\" ( state capacity ), and interaction between agriculture and industry. [ 131 ]\n",
      "Historical and current Confucianists were and are often environmentalists [ 16 ] out of their respect for tian and the other aspects of nature and the \"Principle\" that comes from their unity and, more generally, harmony as a whole, which is \"the basis for a sincere mind\". [ 132 ]\n",
      "After Confucianism had become the official 'state religion' in China, its influence penetrated all walks of life and all streams of thought in Chinese society for the generations to come. This did not exclude martial arts culture. Though in his own day, Confucius had rejected the practice of Martial Arts (with the exception of Archery), he did serve under rulers who used military power extensively to achieve their goals. In later centuries, Confucianism heavily influenced many educated martial artists of great influence, such as Sun Lutang , [ citation needed ] especially from the 19th century onwards, when bare-handed martial arts in China became more widespread and had begun to more readily absorb philosophical influences from Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism .\n",
      "Eastward spread of Western learning\n",
      "Confucius and Confucianism were opposed or criticised from the start, including Laozi 's philosophy and Mozi 's critique, and Legalists such as Han Fei ridiculed the idea that virtue would lead people to be orderly. In modern times, waves of opposition and vilification showed that Confucianism, instead of taking credit for the glories of Chinese civilisation, now had to take blame for its failures. The Taiping Rebellion described Confucianism sages as well as gods in Taoism and Buddhism as devils.\n",
      "In the New Culture Movement , Lu Xun criticised Confucianism for shaping Chinese people into the condition they had reached by the late Qing dynasty : his criticisms are expressed metaphorically in the work \" Diary of a Madman \", in which traditional Chinese Confucian society is portrayed as feudalistic, hypocritical, socially cannibalistic, despotic, fostering a \"slave mentality\" favouring despotism, lack of critical thinking and blind obedience and worship of authority, fuelling a form of \"Confucian authoritarianism\" which persists into the present day. [ 133 ] Leftists during the Cultural Revolution described Confucius as the representative of the slave-owning class. [ 134 ]\n",
      "In South Korea , there has long been criticism. Some South Koreans believe Confucianism has not contributed to the modernisation of South Korea. For example, South Korean writer Kim Kyong-il wrote a book in 1998 entitled \"Confucius Must Die For the Nation to Live\" ( 공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다 , gongjaga jug-eoya naraga sanda ). Kim said that filial piety is one-sided and blind, and if it continues, social problems will continue as government keeps forcing Confucian filial obligations onto families. [ 135 ]\n",
      "Confucianism \"largely defined the mainstream discourse on gender in China from the Han dynasty onward.\" [ 136 ] The gender roles prescribed in the Three Obediences and Four Virtues became a cornerstone of the family, and thus, societal stability. The Three Obediences and Four Virtues is one of the moral standards for feudal etiquette to bind women. [ 137 ] Starting from the Han period, Confucians began to teach that a virtuous woman was supposed to follow the males in her family: the father before her marriage, the husband after she marries, and her sons in widowhood. In the later dynasties, more emphasis was placed on the virtue of chastity. The Song dynasty Confucian Cheng Yi stated that: \"To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter.\" [ 138 ] It was during the Song dynasty that the value of chastity was so severe, Confucian scholars criminalized the remarriage of widows. [ 137 ] Widows were revered and memorialised during the Ming and Qing periods. The principle of chaste widowhood was made an official institution during the Ming dynasty. This \" cult of chastity \" accordingly condemned many widows to poverty and loneliness by placing a social stigma on remarriage. [ 136 ] Though the repercussions for widows at times went beyond poverty and loneliness, as for some the preservation of chastity resulted in suicide. The ideal of a chaste widow became an extremely high honor and esteem, especially for a woman who chose to end her life after her husband's death. Many instances of such acts were recorded in, Biographies of Virtuous Women, “a collection of stories of women who distinguished themselves by committing suicide after their husband’s deaths to guard their chastity and purity”. Though it can be contested whether all these instances can be deemed self-sacrificing for the virtue of chastity, as it became common practice for women to be forced to commit suicide after their husband's death. This resulted from the honor which chaste widowhood garnered, lending itself to the husband's family as well as his clan or village. [ 137 ]\n",
      "For years, many modern scholars have regarded Confucianism as a sexist, patriarchal ideology that was historically damaging to Chinese women. [ 137 ] [ 139 ] : 15–16 It has also been argued by some Chinese and Western writers that the rise of neo-Confucianism during the Song dynasty had led to a decline of status of women. [ 138 ] : 10–12 Some critics have also accused the prominent Song neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Xi for believing in the inferiority of women and that men and women need to be kept strictly separate, [ 140 ] while Sima Guang also believed that women should remain indoors and not deal with the matters of men in the outside world. [ 138 ] : 24–25 [ 141 ] Finally, scholars have discussed the attitudes toward women in Confucian texts such as Analects . In a much-discussed passage, women are grouped together with 'small people' ( 小人 ), meaning people of low status or low morals) and described as being difficult to cultivate or deal with. [ 142 ] Many traditional commentators and modern scholars have debated over the precise meaning of the passage, and whether Confucius referred to all women or just certain groups of women. [ 143 ] [ 144 ]\n",
      "Further analysis suggests, however, that women's place in Confucian society may be more complex. [ 136 ] During the Han dynasty period, the influential Confucian text Lessons for Women was written by Ban Zhao (45–114 CE) to instruct her daughters how to be proper Confucian wives and mothers, that is, to be silent, hard-working, and compliant. She stresses the complementarity and equal importance of the male and female roles according to yin-yang theory, but she clearly accepts the dominance of the male. However, she does present education and literary power as important for women. In later dynasties, a number of women took advantage of the Confucian acknowledgment of education to become independent in thought. [ 136 ]\n",
      "Joseph A. Adler points out that \"Neo-Confucian writings do not necessarily reflect either the prevailing social practices or the scholars' own attitudes and practices in regard to actual women.\" [ 136 ] Matthew Sommers has also indicated that the Qing dynasty government began to realise the utopian nature of enforcing the \"cult of chastity\" and began to allow practices such as widow remarrying to stand. [ 145 ] Moreover, some Confucian texts like Dong Zhongshu 's Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals have passages that suggest a more equal relationship between a husband and his wife. [ 146 ] More recently, some scholars have also begun to discuss the viability of constructing a \"Confucian feminism\". [ 139 ] : 4, 149–160\n",
      "Ever since Europeans first encountered Confucianism, the issue of how Confucianism should be classified has been subject to debate. In the 16th and the 17th centuries, the earliest European arrivals in China, the Christian Jesuits , considered Confucianism to be an ethical system, not a religion, and one that was compatible with Christianity. [ 147 ] The Jesuits, including Matteo Ricci , saw Chinese rituals as \"civil rituals\" that could co-exist alongside the spiritual rituals of Catholicism. [ 147 ]\n",
      "By the early 18th century, this initial portrayal was rejected by the Dominicans and Franciscans , creating a dispute among Catholics in East Asia that was known as the \"Rites Controversy\". [ 148 ] The Dominicans and Franciscans argued that Chinese ancestral worship was a form of idolatry that was contradictory to the tenets of Christianity. This view was reinforced by Pope Benedict XIV , who ordered a ban on Chinese rituals, [ 148 ] though this ban was re-assessed and repealed in 1939 by Pope Pius XII , provided that such traditions harmonize with the true and authentic spirit of the liturgy. [ 149 ]\n",
      "Some critics view Confucianism as definitely pantheistic and nontheistic , in that it is not based on the belief in the supernatural or in a personal god existing separate from the temporal plane. [ 8 ] [ 150 ] Confucius views about tian and about the divine providence ruling the world, can be found above (in this page) and in Analects 6:26, 7:22, and 9:12, for example. On spirituality, Confucius said to Chi Lu, one of his students: \"You are not yet able to serve men, how can you serve spirits?\" [ 151 ] Attributes such as ancestor worship , ritual , and sacrifice were advocated by Confucius as necessary for social harmony; these attributes may be traced to the traditional Chinese folk religion .\n",
      "Scholars recognise that classification ultimately depends on how one defines religion. Using stricter definitions of religion, Confucianism has been described as a moral science or philosophy. [ 152 ] [ 153 ] But using a broader definition, such as Frederick Streng 's characterisation of religion as \"a means of ultimate transformation\", [ 154 ] Confucianism could be described as a \"sociopolitical doctrine having religious qualities\". [ 150 ] With the latter definition, Confucianism is religious, even if non-theistic, in the sense that it \"performs some of the basic psycho-social functions of full-fledged religions\". [ 150 ]\n"

      "Taoism or Daoism ( / ˈ t aʊ . ɪ z əm / ⓘ , / ˈ d aʊ . ɪ z əm / ⓘ ) is a diverse philosophical and religious tradition indigenous to China , emphasizing harmony with the Tao 道 ( pinyin : dào ; Wade–Giles : tao 4 ). With a range of meaning in Chinese philosophy, translations of Tao include 'way', 'road', 'path', or 'technique', generally understood in the Taoist sense as an enigmatic process of transformation ultimately underlying reality . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Taoist thought has informed the development of various practices within the Taoist tradition and beyond, including forms of meditation , astrology , qigong , feng shui , and internal alchemy . A common goal of Taoist practice is self-cultivation , a deeper appreciation of the Tao, and more harmonious existence. Taoist ethics vary, but generally emphasize such virtues as effortless action , naturalness , simplicity , and the three treasures of compassion, frugality, and humility.\n",
      "The core of Taoist thought crystallized during the early Warring States period ( c. 450 – c. 300 BCE ), during which the epigrammatic Tao Te Ching and the anecdotal Zhuangzi —widely regarded as the fundamental texts of Taoist philosophy—were largely composed. They form the core of a body of Taoist writings accrued over the following centuries, which was assembled by monks into the Daozang canon starting in the 5th century CE. Early Taoism drew upon diverse influences, including the Shang and Zhou state religions, Naturalism , Mohism , Confucianism , various Legalist theories, as well as the I Ching and Spring and Autumn Annals . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]\n",
      "While Taoism and Confucianism often developed in a manner informed by the significant differences between the two traditions, they are not understood to be incompatible or mutually exclusive. The relationship between Taoism and Buddhism upon the latter's introduction to China is characterized as one of mutual influence, with long-running discourses shared between Taoists and Buddhists; the distinct Mahayana tradition of Zen that emerged during the Tang dynasty (607–917) incorporates many ideas from Taoism.\n",
      "Many Taoist denominations recognize deities , often ones shared with other traditions, which are venerated as superhuman figures exemplifying Taoist virtues. They can be roughly divided into two categories of \"gods\" and xian (or \"immortals\"). Xian were immortal beings with vast supernatural powers, also describing a principled, moral person. Since Taoist thought is syncretic and deeply rooted in Chinese culture for millennia, it is often unclear which denominations should be considered \"Taoist\". The status of daoshi , or 'Taoist master', is traditionally attributed only to clergy in Taoist organizations, who distinguish between their traditions and others in Chinese folk religion . [ 6 ] Though generally lacking motivation for strong hierarchies, Taoist philosophy has often served as a theoretical foundation for politics, warfare, and Taoist organizations. [ 7 ] Taoist secret societies precipitated the Yellow Turban Rebellion during the late Han dynasty , attempting to create what has been characterized as a Taoist theocracy . [ 8 ]\n",
      "Today, Taoism is one of five religious doctrines officially recognized by the Chinese government, also having official status in Hong Kong and Macau . [ 9 ] It is considered a major religion in Taiwan , [ 10 ] and also has significant populations of adherents throughout the Sinosphere and Southeast Asia. In the West, Taoism has taken on various forms , both those hewing to historical practice, as well as highly synthesized practices variously characterized as new religious movements .\n",
      "\"Taoism\" and \"Daoism\" are alternate spellings of the same word. \"Tao\" is in the Wade-Giles romanization system, which was predominant in English-speaking countries until the late 20th century, and remains in use for certain terms with strongly established spellings. \"Dao\" is the spelling in the Hanyu Pinyin system, officially adopted in China in the 1950s, which has largely replaced Wade–Giles.\n",
      "The Standard Chinese pronunciation of both romanizations of the character \"Dao\" is the same; that is, /daʊ/ , much like the English \"dow\". One authority calls the pronunciation with a <t> as in \"tie\" to be a \"mispronunciation\" originally caused by the \"clumsy Wade-Giles system,\" which misled most readers. [ 11 ]\n",
      "The word Taoism is used to translate two related but distinct Chinese terms. [ 12 ]\n",
      "The distinction between Taoism in philosophy and Taoist religion is an ancient, deeply-rooted one. Taoism is a positive philosophy that aims for the holistic unification of an individual's reality with everything that is not only real but also valuable, encompassing both the natural world and society. [ 18 ] The earliest references to 'the Tao' per se are largely devoid of liturgical or explicitly supernatural character, used in contexts either of abstract metaphysics or of the ordinary conditions required for human flourishing. This distinction is still understood in everyday contexts among Chinese people, and has been echoed by modern scholars of Chinese history and philosophy such as Feng Youlan and Wing-tsit Chan . Use of the term daojia dates to the Western Han c. 100 BCE , referring to the purported authors of the emerging Taoist canon, such as Lao Dan and Zhuang Zhou . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Neither the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi themselves, nor the early secondary sources written about them, put forward any particular supernatural ontology. Nonetheless, that religious Taoism emerged from a synthesis of folk religion with philosophical Taoist precepts is clear. The earlier, naturalistic was employed by pre-Han and Han thinkers, and continued to be used well into the Song, including among those who explicitly rejected cults, both private and state-sanctioned, that were often either labeled or self-identified as Taoist.\n",
      "However, this distinction has been challenged or rejected by some scholars of religion, often those from a Western or Japanese background, who often use distinct interpretive models and techniques. [ 21 ] This point of view characterizes the religious and philosophical characteristics of the Taoist tradition as being inseparable. Sinologists such as Isabelle Robinet and Livia Kohn state that \"Taoism has never been a unified religion, and has constantly consisted of a combination of teachings based on a variety of original revelations.\" The distinction is fraught with hermeneutic difficulties when attempting to categorize different schools, sects, and movements. [ 22 ] Russell Kirkland writes that \"most scholars who have seriously studied Taoism, both in Asia and in the West\" have abandoned this \"simplistic dichotomy\". [ 23 ] Louis Komjathy writes that this is an untenable misconception because \"the association of daojia with \"thought\" ( sixiang ) and of daojiao with \"religion\" ( zongjiao ) is a modern Chinese construction largely rooted in earlier Chinese literati, European colonialist, and Protestant missionary interpretations. Contemporaneous Neo-Confucianists, for example, often self-identify as Taoist without partaking in any rituals. [ 24 ]\n",
      "In contrast, Komjathy characterizes Taoism as \"a unified religious tradition characterized by complexity and diversity\", arguing that historically, none of these terms were understood according to a bifurcated 'philosophy' versus 'religion' model. Daojia was a taxonomical category for Taoist texts, that was eventually applied to Taoist movements and priests in the early medieval period. [ 25 ] Meanwhile, daojiao was originally used to specifically distinguish Taoist tradition from Buddhism. Thus, daojiao included daojia . [ 25 ] Komjathy notes that the earliest Taoist texts also \"reveal a religious community composed of master-disciple lineages\", and therefore, that \"Taoism was a religious tradition from the beginning.\" [ 25 ] Philosopher Chung-ying Cheng likewise views Taoism as a religion embedded into Chinese history and tradition, while also assuming many different \"forms of philosophy and practical wisdom\". [ 26 ] Chung-ying Cheng also noted that the Taoist view of 'heaven' mainly from \"observation and meditation, [though] the teaching of [the Tao] can also include the way of heaven independently of human nature\". [ 26 ] Taoism is generally not understood as a variant of Chinese folk religion per se: while the two umbrella terms have considerable cultural overlap, core themes of both also diverge considerably from one another. [ 27 ]\n",
      "Traditionally, the Chinese language does not have terms defining lay people adhering to the doctrines or the practices of Taoism, who fall instead within the field of folk religion. Taoist, in Western sinology , is traditionally used to translate daoshi /taoshih ( 道士 ; 'master of the Tao'), thus strictly defining the priests of Taoism, ordained clergymen of a Taoist institution who \"represent Taoist culture on a professional basis\", are experts of Taoist liturgy, and therefore can employ this knowledge and ritual skill for the benefit of a community. [ 28 ]\n",
      "This role of Taoist priests reflects the definition of Taoism as a \" liturgical framework for the development of local cults\", in other words a scheme or structure for Chinese religion, proposed first by the scholar and Taoist initiate Kristofer Schipper in The Taoist Body (1986). [ 29 ] Taoshi are comparable to the non-Taoist ritual masters ( 法師 ) of vernacular traditions (the so-called Faism ) within Chinese religion. [ 29 ]\n",
      "The term dàojiàotú ( 道教徒 ; 'follower of Dao'), with the meaning of \"Taoist\" as \"lay member or believer of Taoism\", is a modern invention that goes back to the introduction of the Western category of \"organized religion\" in China in the 20th century, but it has no significance for most of Chinese society in which Taoism continues to be an \"order\" of the larger body of Chinese religion.\n",
      "Scholars like Harold Roth argue that early Taoism was a series of \"inner-cultivation lineages\" of master-disciple communities, emphasizing a contentless and nonconceptual apophatic meditation as a way of achieving union with the Tao. [ 30 ] According to Louis Komjathy, their worldview \"emphasized the Dao as sacred, and the universe and each individual being as a manifestation of the Dao.\" [ 31 ] These communities were also closely related to and intermixed with the fangshi (method master) communities. [ 32 ] Other scholars, like Russell Kirkland, argue that before the Han dynasty, there were no real \"Taoists\" or \"Taoism\". Instead, there were various sets of behaviors, practices, and interpretative frameworks (like the ideas of the Yijing , yin-yang thought , as well as Mohist , \" Legalist \", and \" Confucian \" ideas), which were eventually synthesized into the first organized forms of \"Taoism\". [ 33 ]\n",
      "Some of the main early Taoist sources include: the Neiye , the Zhuangzi , and the Tao Te Ching . [ 34 ] The Tao Te Ching , attributed to Laozi , is dated by scholars to sometime between the 4th and 6th century BCE. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] A common tradition holds that Laozi founded Taoism. [ 37 ] Laozi's historicity is disputed, with many scholars seeing him as a legendary founding figure. [ 38 ] [ 39 ]\n",
      "While Taoism is often regarded in the West as arising from Laozi, many Chinese Taoists claim that the Yellow Emperor formulated many of their precepts, [ 40 ] including the quest for \"long life\". [ 41 ] Traditionally, the Yellow Emperor's founding of Taoism was said to have been because he \"dreamed of an ideal kingdom whose tranquil inhabitants lived in harmonious accord with the natural law and possessed virtues remarkably like those espoused by early Taoism. On waking from his dream, Huangdi sought to\" bring about \"these virtues in his own kingdom, to ensure order and prosperity among the inhabitants\". [ 42 ]\n",
      "Afterwards, Taoism developed and grew into two sects; One is Zhengyi Taoism, which mainly focuses on spells, and the other is Quanzhen Taoism, which mainly focuses on practicing inner alchemy. Overall, traditional Taoist thought, content, and sects are varied, reflecting the ideal of \"absorbing everything inside and mixing everything outside\". [ 43 ]\n",
      "Early Taoism drew on the ideas found in the religion of the Shang dynasty and the Zhou dynasty , such as their use of divination , ancestor worship , and the idea of Heaven ( Tian ) and its relationship to humanity. [ 4 ] According to modern scholars of Taoism, such as Kirkland and Livia Kohn , Taoist philosophy also developed by drawing on numerous schools of thought from the Warring States period (4th to 3rd centuries BCE), including Mohism , Confucianism , Legalist theorists (like Shen Buhai and Han Fei , which speak of wu wei ), the School of Naturalists (from which Taoism draws its main cosmological ideas, yin and yang and the five phases ), and the Chinese classics , especially the I Ching and the Lüshi Chunqiu . [ 44 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]\n",
      "Meanwhile, Isabelle Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism: the teachings found in the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi , techniques for achieving ecstasy, practices for achieving longevity and becoming an immortal ( xian ), and practices for exorcism . [ 38 ] Robinet states that some elements of Taoism may be traced to prehistoric folk religions in China. [ 45 ] In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring States era phenomena of the wu ( Chinese shamans ) and the fangshi (\"method masters\", which probably derived from the \"archivist-soothsayers of antiquity\"). [ 46 ]\n",
      "Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to \"...magic, medicine, divination,... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings\" as well as exorcism. [ 46 ] The fangshi were philosophically close to the School of Naturalists and relied greatly on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities. [ 47 ] Female shamans played an important role in the early Taoist tradition, which was particularly strong in the southern state of Chu . Early Taoist movements developed their own tradition in contrast to shamanism while also absorbing shamanic elements. [ 48 ]\n",
      "During the early period, some Taoists lived as hermits or recluses who did not participate in political life, while others sought to establish a harmonious society based on Taoist principles. [ 31 ] Zhuang Zhou (c. 370–290 BCE) was the most influential of the Taoist hermits. Some scholars holds that since he lived in the south, he may have been influenced by Chinese shamanism . [ 49 ] Zhuang Zhou and his followers insisted they were the heirs of ancient traditions and the ways of life of by-then legendary kingdoms. [ 50 ] Pre-Taoist philosophers and mystics whose activities may have influenced Taoism included shamans, naturalists skilled in understanding the properties of plants and geology , diviners , early environmentalists , tribal chieftains, court scribes and commoner members of governments, members of the nobility in Chinese states, and the descendants of refugee communities. [ 51 ]\n",
      "Significant movements in early Taoism disregarded the existence of gods, and many who believed in gods thought they were subject to the natural law of the Tao, in a similar nature to all other life. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Roughly contemporaneously to the Tao Te Ching , some believed the Tao was a force that was the \"basis of all existence\" and more powerful than the gods, while being a god-like being that was an ancestor and a mother goddess . [ 54 ]\n",
      "Early Taoists studied the natural world in attempts to find what they thought were supernatural laws that governed existence. [ 36 ] Taoists created scientific principles that were the first of their kind in China, and the belief system has been known to merge scientific, philosophical, and religious conceits from close to its beginning. [ 36 ]\n",
      "By the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), the various sources of Taoism had coalesced into a coherent tradition of ritualists in the state of Shu (modern Sichuan ). [ 49 ] One of the earliest forms of Taoism was the Han era ( 2nd century BCE ) Huang–Lao movement, which was an influential school of thought at this time. [ 55 ] The Huainanzi and the Taipingjing are important sources from this period. [ 56 ] An unorganized form of Taoism was popular in the Han dynasty that syncretized many preexisting forms in multiple ways for different groups existed during a rough span of time throughout the 2nd century BCE. [ 57 ] Also during the Han, the earliest extant commentaries on the Tao Te Ching were written: the Heshang Gong commentary and the Xiang'er commentary. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]\n",
      "The first organized form of Taoism was the Way of the Celestial Masters , which developed from the Five Pecks of Rice movement at the end of the 2nd century CE. The latter had been founded by Zhang Daoling , who was said to have had a vision of Laozi in 142 CE and claimed that the world was coming to an end. [ 60 ] [ 8 ] Zhang sought to teach people to repent and prepare for the coming cataclysm, after which they would become the seeds of a new era of great peace. It was a mass movement in which men and women could act as libationers and tend to the commoners. [ 61 ] A related movement arose in Shandong called the \" Way of Great Peace \", seeking to create a new world by replacing the Han dynasty. This movement led to the Yellow Turban Rebellion , and after years of bloody war, they were crushed. [ 8 ]\n",
      "The Celestial Masters movement survived this period and did not take part in attempting to replace the Han. As such, they grew and became an influential religion during the Three Kingdoms period, focusing on ritual confession and petition, as well as developing a well-organized religious structure. [ 62 ] The Celestial Masters school was officially recognized by the warlord Cao Cao in 215 CE, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return. [ 63 ] Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century BCE. [ 64 ]\n",
      "Another important early Taoist movement was Taiqing (Great Clarity), which was a tradition of external alchemy (weidan) that sought immortality through the concoction of elixirs, often using toxic elements like cinnabar , lead , mercury , and realgar , as well as ritual and purificatory practices. [ 65 ]\n",
      "After this point, Taoism did not have nearly as significant an effect on the passing of law as the syncretic Confucian - Legalist tradition. [ citation needed ]\n",
      "The Three Kingdoms period saw the rise of the Xuanxue (Mysterious Learning or Deep Wisdom) tradition, which focused on philosophical inquiry and integrated Confucian teachings with Taoist thought. The movement included scholars like Wang Bi (226–249), He Yan (d. 249), Xiang Xiu (223?–300), Guo Xiang (d. 312), and Pei Wei (267–300). [ 66 ] Another later influential figure was the 4th century alchemist Ge Hong , who wrote a key Taoist work on inner cultivation, the Baopuzi ( Master Embracing Simplicity ). [ 67 ]\n",
      "The Six Dynasties (316–589) era saw the rise of two new Taoist traditions, the Shangqing and Lingbao schools. Shangqing was based on a series of revelations by gods and spirits to a certain Yang Xi between 364 and 370. As Livia Kohn writes, these revelations included detailed descriptions of the heavens as well as \"specific methods of shamanic travels or ecstatic excursions, visualizations, and alchemical concoctions.\" [ 68 ] The Shangqing revelations also introduced many new Taoist scriptures. [ 69 ]\n",
      "Similarly, between 397 and 402, Ge Chaofu compiled a series of scriptures that later served as the foundation of the Lingbao school , which was most influential during the later Song dynasty (960–1279) and focused on scriptural recitation and the use of talismans for harmony and longevity. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] The Lingbao school practiced purification rituals called \"purgations\" in which talismans were empowered. Lingbao also adopted Mahayana Buddhist elements. According to Kohn, they \"integrated aspects of Buddhist cosmology , worldview, scriptures, and practices, and created a vast new collection of Taoist texts in close imitation of Buddhist sutras .\" [ 72 ] Louis Komjathy also notes that they adopted the Mahayana Buddhist universalism in its promotion of \"universal salvation\" (pudu). [ 73 ]\n",
      "During this period, Louguan , the first Taoist monastic institution (influenced by Buddhist monasticism ) was established in the Zhongnan mountains by a local Taoist master named Yin Tong. This tradition was called the Northern Celestial masters , and their main scripture was the Xisheng jing ( Scripture of Western Ascension ). [ 74 ]\n",
      "During the sixth century, Taoists attempted to unify the various traditions into one integrated Taoism that could compete with Buddhism and Confucianism. To do this they adopted the schema known as the \"three caverns\", first developed by the scholar Lu Xiujing (406–477) based on the \" three vehicles \" of Buddhism. The three caverns were: Perfection (Dongzhen), associated with the Three Sovereigns ; Mystery (Dongxuan), associated with Lingbao; and Spirit (Dongshen), associated with the Supreme Clarity tradition. [ 75 ] Lu Xiujing also used this schema to arrange the Taoist scriptures and Taoist deities. Lu Xiujing worked to compile the first edition of the Daozang (the Taoist Canon), which was published at the behest of the Chinese emperor . Thus, according to Russell Kirkland, \"in several important senses, it was really Lu Hsiu-ching who founded Taoism, for it was he who first gained community acceptance for a common canon of texts, which established the boundaries, and contents, of 'the teachings of the Tao' (Tao-chiao). Lu also reconfigured the ritual activities of the tradition, and formulated a new set of liturgies, which continue to influence Taoist practice to the present day.\" [ 76 ]\n",
      "This period also saw the development of the Three Pure Ones , which merged the high deities from different Taoist traditions into a common trinity that has remained influential until today. [ 75 ]\n",
      "The new Integrated Taoism, now with a united Taoist identity, gained official status in China during the Tang dynasty . This tradition was termed daojiao (the teaching of the Tao). [ 77 ] The Tang was the height of Taoist influence, during which Taoism, led by the Patriarch of Supreme Clarity, was the dominant religion in China. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 77 ] According to Russell Kirkland, this new Taoist synthesis had its main foundation in the Lingbao school's teachings, which was appealing to all classes of society and drew on Mahayana Buddhism. [ 80 ]\n",
      "Perhaps the most important figure of the Tang was the court Taoist and writer Du Guangting (850–933). Du wrote numerous works about Taoist rituals, history, myth, and biography. He also reorganized and edited the Taotsang after a period of war and loss. [ 81 ]\n",
      "During the Tang, several emperors became patrons of Taoism, inviting priests to court to conduct rituals and enhance the prestige of the sovereign. [ 82 ] The Gaozong Emperor even decreed that the Tao Te Ching was to be a topic in the imperial examinations. [ 83 ] During the reign of the 7th century Emperor Taizong , the Five Dragons Temple (the first temple at the Wudang Mountains ) was constructed. [ 84 ] Wudang would eventually become a major center for Taoism and a home for Taoist martial arts ( Wudang quan ).\n",
      "Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–755) was also a devoted Taoist who wrote various Taoist works, and according to Livia Kohn , \"had frequent meetings with senior masters, ritual specialists, Taoist poets, and official patriarchs, such as Sima Chengzhen.\" [ 85 ] He reorganized imperial rituals based on Taoist forms, sponsored Taoist shrines and monasteries, and introduced a separate examination system based on Taoism. [ 85 ] Another important Taoist figure of the Tang dynasty was Lu Dongbin , who is considered the founder of the jindan meditation tradition and an influential figure in the development of neidan (internal alchemy) practice.\n",
      "Likewise, several Song dynasty emperors, most notably Huizong , were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts, and publishing updated editions of the Daozang . [ 86 ] The Song era saw new scriptures and new movements of ritualists and Taoist rites, the most popular of which were the Thunder Rites (leifa). The Thunder rites were protection and exorcism rites that evoked the celestial department of thunder, and they became central to the new Heavenly Heart (Tianxin) tradition as well as for the Youthful Incipience (Tongchu) school. [ 87 ]\n",
      "In the 12th century , the Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) School was founded in Shandong by the sage Wang Chongyang (1113–1170) to compete with religious Taoist traditions that worshipped \" ghosts and gods \" and largely displaced them. [ 88 ] The school focused on inner transformation, [ 88 ] mystical experience , [ 88 ] monasticism , and asceticism . [ 89 ] [ 90 ] Quanzhen flourished during the 13th and 14th centuries and during the Yuan dynasty . The Quanzhen school was syncretic, combining elements from Buddhism and Confucianism with Taoist tradition. According to Wang Chongyang, the \" three teachings \" (Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism), \"when investigated, prove to be but one school\". [ 91 ] Quanzhen became the largest and most important Taoist school in China when master Qiu Chuji met with Genghis Khan who ended up making him the leader of all Chinese religions as well as exempting Quanzhen institutions from taxation. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Another important Quanzhen figure was Zhang Boduan, author of the Wuzhen pian , a classic of internal alchemy, and the founder of the southern branch of Quanzhen.\n",
      "During the Song era, the Zhengyi Dao tradition properly developed in Southern China among Taoists of the Chang clan. [ 94 ] This liturgically focused tradition would continue to be supported by later emperors and survives to this day. [ 95 ]\n",
      "In the Yuan dynasty, Taoism in Northern China took inspiration from Tibetan cultural practices, Chinese folk religion (often from the western parts of the Yuan dynasty's land), and Tibetan Buddhism . [ 96 ]\n",
      "Under the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), aspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and East Asian Buddhism were consciously synthesized in the Neo-Confucian school, which eventually became Imperial orthodoxy for state bureaucratic purposes. [ 97 ] Taoist ideas also influenced Neo-Confucian thinkers like Wang Yangming and Zhan Ruoshui . [ 98 ] During the Ming, the legends of the Eight Immortals (the most important of which is Lü Dongbin ) rose to prominence, being part of local plays and folk culture. [ 99 ] Ming emperors like the Hongwu Emperor continued to invite Taoists to court and hold Taoist rituals that were believed to enhance the power of the throne. The most important of these were connected with the Taoist deity Xuanwu (\"Perfect Warrior\"), which was the main dynastic protector deity of the Ming. [ 82 ]\n",
      "The Ming era saw the rise of the Jingming (\"Pure Illumination\") school to prominence, which merged Taoism with Buddhist and Confucian teachings and focused on \"purity, clarity, loyalty and filial piety \". [ 100 ] [ 101 ] The school derided internal and external alchemy, fasting ( bigu ), and breathwork. Instead, the school focused on using mental cultivation to return to the mind's original purity and clarity (which could become obscured by desires and emotions). [ 100 ] Key figures of this school include Xu Xun, Liu Yu, Huang Yuanji, Xu Yi, and Liu Yuanran. Some of these figures taught at the imperial capital and were awarded titles. [ 100 ] Their emphasis on practical ethics and self-cultivation in everyday life (rather than ritual or monasticism) made it very popular among the literati class. [ 102 ]\n",
      "The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) mainly promoted Buddhism as well as Neo-Confucianism . [ 102 ] Thus, during this period, the status and influence of Taoism declined. During the 18th century, the Qing imperial library excluded virtually all Taoist books. [ 103 ]\n",
      "The Qing era also saw the birth of the Longmen (\"Dragon Gate\" 龍門 ) school of Wang Kunyang (1552–1641), a branch of Quanzhen from southern China that became established at the White Cloud Temple . [ 104 ] [ 105 ] Longmen authors like Liu Yiming (1734–1821) and Min Yide (1758–1836) worked to promote and preserve Taoist inner alchemy practices through books like The Secret of the Golden Flower . [ 106 ] The Longmen school synthesized the Quanzhen and neidan teachings with the Chan Buddhist and Neo-Confucian elements that the Jingming tradition had developed, making it widely appealing to the literati class. [ 107 ]\n",
      "During the 19th and 20th centuries, Taoism suffered much destruction as a result of religious persecution and numerous wars and conflicts that beset China in the so-called century of humiliation . This period of persecution was caused by numerous factors including Confucian prejudices, anti-traditional Chinese modernist ideologies, European and Japanese colonialism , and Christian missionization . [ 108 ] By the 20th century, only one complete copy of the Tao Tsang survived intact, stored at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing . [ 109 ] A key Taoist figure during this period was Chen Yingning (1880–1969). He was a key member of the early Chinese Taoist Association and wrote numerous books promoting Taoist practice. [ 110 ]\n",
      "During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), many Taoist priests were laicized and sent to work camps, and many Taoist sites and temples were destroyed or converted to secular use. [ 111 ] [ 112 ] This period saw an exodus of Taoists out of China. They immigrated to Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and to Europe and North America. Thus, the communist repression had the consequence of making Taoism a world religion by disseminating Taoists throughout the world. [ 113 ]\n",
      "In the 1910s, Taoist doctrine about immortals and waiting until after death to live in \"the dwelling of the immortals\" was one of the faith's most popular and influential beliefs. [ 114 ]\n",
      "The 20th century was also a creative period for Taoism despite its many setbacks. The Taoist influenced practice of Tai Chi developed during this time, led by figures like Yang Chengfu and Sun Lutang . [ 115 ] Early proponents of Tai Chi Quan, like Sun Lutang, claimed that Tai Chi was a Taoist internal practice created by the Taoist immortal Zhang Sanfeng (though modern scholars note that this claim lacks credible historical evidence). [ 116 ]\n",
      "Taoism began to recover during the Reform and Opening up period (beginning in 1979) during which mainland China experienced increased religious freedom. [ 117 ] This led to the restoration of many temples and communities, the publishing of Taoist literature and the preservation of Taoist material culture. [ 118 ] Several Chinese intellectuals, like Hu Fuchen (Chinese Academy of Social Studies) and Liu Xiaogan (Chinese University of Hong Kong) have worked to developed a \"New Daojia\" ( xin daojia ), which parallels the rise of New Confucianism . [ 119 ]\n",
      "During the 1980s and 1990s, China experienced the so-called Qigong fever , which saw a surge in the popularity of Qigong practice throughout China. During this period many new Taoist and Taoist influenced religions sprung up, the most popular being those associated with Qigong, such as Zangmigong ( Tantric Qigong influenced by Tibetan Buddhism ), Zhonggong (Central Qigong), and Falungong (which came to be outlawed and repressed by the Chinese Communist Party [CCP]). [ 110 ] Today, Taoism is one of five official recognized religions in the People's Republic of China . In mainland China, the government regulates its activities through the Chinese Taoist Association . [ 120 ] Regarding the status of Taoism in mainland China, Livia Kohn writes:\n",
      "Taoist institutions are state-owned, monastics are paid by the government, several bureaus compete for revenues and administrative power, and training centers require courses in Marxism as preparation for full ordination. Still, temple compounds are growing on the five sacred mountains, on Taoist mountains, and in all major cities. [ 121 ]\n",
      "The White Cloud Temple at Beijing remains the most important center for the training of Taoist monastics on the mainland, while the five sacred mountains of China also contain influential Taoist centers. Other key sites include: Wudangshan , Mount Longhu , Mount Qiyun , Mount Qingcheng , Mount Tai , Zhongnan mountains , Mount Mao , and Mount Lao . [ 122 ] Meanwhile, Taoism is also practiced much more freely in Taiwan and Hong Kong , where it is a major religion and retains unique features and movements that differ from mainland Taoism. [ 123 ] Taoism is also practiced throughout the wider East Asian cultural sphere . [ 124 ]\n",
      "Outside of China, many traditionally Taoist practices have spread, especially through Chinese emigration as well as conversion by non-Chinese. [ 124 ] Taoist influenced practices, like Tai chi and qigong , are also popular around the world. [ 125 ] Its influence is ubiquitous, especially in divination and magical practices. [ 126 ] [ citation needed ] As such, Taoism is now a religion with a global distribution. [ 124 ]\n",
      "Taoism has been traditionally associated with Northern China , [ 127 ] [ 96 ] Southern China , [ 128 ] and Western China , [ 96 ] and originated from Southern China. [ 129 ]\n",
      "During the late 20th century, Taoism began to spread to the Western world , leading to various forms of Taoist communities in the West, with Taoist publications, websites, meditation and Tai chi centers, and translations of Taoist texts by western scholars as well as non-specialists. [ 130 ] Taoist classics like the Tao Te Ching have also become popular in the New Age movement and in \"popular Western Taoism\", a kind of popularized hybrid spirituality. [ 131 ] According to Louis Komjathy, this \"popular Western Taoism\" is associated with popular translations and interpretations of the Tao Te Ching and the work of popular figures like James Legge , Alan Watts , John Blofeld , Gia-fu Feng , and Bruce Lee . [ 132 ] This popular spirituality also draws on Chinese martial arts (which are often unrelated to Taoism proper), American Transcendentalism , 1960s counterculture , New Age spirituality , the perennial philosophy , and alternative medicine . [ 133 ]\n",
      "On the other hand, traditionally minded Taoists in the West are often either ethnically Chinese or generally assume some level of sinicization , especially the adoption of Chinese language and culture. This is because, for most traditional Taoists, the religion is not seen as separate from Chinese ethnicity and culture. As such, most Western convert Taoist groups are led either by Chinese teachers or by teachers who studied with Chinese teachers. [ 134 ] Some prominent Western Taoist associations include: Associacion de Taoism de España, Association Francaise Daoiste, British Daoist Association, Daoist Foundation (San Diego, California), American Taoist and Buddhist Association (New York), Ching Chung Taoist Association (San Francisco), Universal Society of the Integral Way (Ni Hua-Ching), and Sociedade Taoista do Brasil. [ 135 ]\n",
      "Particularly popular in the West are groups that focus on internal martial arts like Taijiquan, as well as qigong and meditation. A smaller set of groups also focus around internal alchemy, such as Mantak Chia 's Healing Tao. [ 136 ] While traditional Taoism initially arrived in the West through Chinese immigrants, more recently, Western run Taoist temples have also appeared, such as the Taoist Sanctuary in San Diego and the Dayuan Circle in San Francisco. Kohn notes that all of these centers \"combine traditional ritual services with Tao Te Ching and Yijing philosophy as well as with various health practices, such as breathing, diet, meditation, qigong, and soft martial arts.\" [ 137 ]\n",
      "Tao (or Dao ) can mean way, road, channel, path, doctrine, or line. [ 138 ] The Tao is a natural order that enables all things to exist and dominate every action, not so much through force as through a natural curvature of space and time. [ 139 ] It is the origin and power of all creation - its essence is unknown, but it can be observed in its manifestation - this is behind the operation and change of nature. [ 140 ] Livia Kohn describes the Tao as \"the underlying cosmic power which creates the universe, supports culture and the state, saves the good and punishes the wicked. Literally 'the way', Tao refers to the way things develop naturally, the way nature moves along and living beings grow and decline in accordance with cosmic laws.\" [ 141 ] The Tao is ultimately indescribable and transcends all analysis and definition. Thus, the Tao Te Ching begins with: \"The Tao that can be told is not eternal Tao.\" [ 141 ] Likewise, Louis Komjathy writes that the Tao has been described by Taoists as \"dark\" (xuan), \"indistinct\" (hu), \"obscure\" (huang), and \"silent\" (mo). [ 142 ]\n",
      "According to Komjathy, the Tao has four primary characteristics: \"(1) Source of all existence; (2) Unnamable mystery; (3) All-pervading sacred presence; and (4) Universe as cosmological process.\" [ 143 ] As such, Taoist thought can be seen as monistic (the Tao is one reality), panenhenic (seeing nature as sacred), and panentheistic (the Tao is both the sacred world and what is beyond it, immanent and transcendent). [ 144 ] Similarly, Wing-Tsit Chan describes the Tao as an \"ontological ground\" and as \"the One, which is natural, spontaneous, eternal, nameless, and indescribable. It is at once the beginning of all things and the way in which all things pursue their course.\" [ 145 ] [ 146 ] The Tao is thus an \"organic order\", which is not a willful or self-conscious creator, but an infinite and boundless natural pattern. [ 141 ]\n",
      "Furthermore, the Tao is something that individuals can find immanent in themselves, as well as in natural and social patterns. [ 147 ] [ 141 ] Thus, the Tao is also the \"innate nature\" ( xing ) of all people, a nature which is seen by Taoists as being ultimately good. [ 148 ] In a naturalistic sense, the Tao as visible pattern, \"the Tao that can be told\", that is, the rhythmic processes and patterns of the natural world that can be observed and described. [ 141 ] Thus, Kohn writes that Tao can be explained as twofold: the transcendent, ineffable, mysterious Tao and the natural, visible, and tangible Tao. [ 141 ]\n",
      "Dao is a process of reality itself, a way for things to gather together while still changing. All of these reflect the deep-rooted belief of the Chinese people that change is the most fundamental characteristic of things. In the Book of Changes, this pattern of change is symbolized by numbers representing 64 related force relationships, known as hexagrams. Dao is the change of these forces, usually simply referred to as yin and yang. [ 149 ]\n",
      "Throughout Taoist history, Taoists have developed different metaphysical views regarding the Tao. For example, while the Xuanxue thinker Wang Bi described Tao as wú (nothingness, negativity, not-being), Guo Xiang rejected wú as the source and held that instead the true source was spontaneous \"self-production\" (zìshēng 自生) and \"self-transformation\" (zìhuà 自化). [ 150 ] Another school, the Chóngxuán (Twofold Mystery), developed a metaphysics influenced by Buddhist Madhyamaka philosophy. [ 151 ]\n",
      "The active expression of Tao is called De ( 德 ; dé ; also spelled, Te or Teh ; often translated with virtue or power), [ 152 ] in a sense that De results from an individual living and cultivating the Tao. [ 153 ] The term De can be used to refer to ethical virtue in the conventional Confucian sense, as well as to a higher spontaneous kind of sagely virtue or power that comes from following the Tao and practicing wu-wei. Thus, it is a natural expression of the Tao's power and not anything like conventional morality . [ 154 ] Louis Komjathy describes De as the manifestation of one's connection to the Tao, which is a beneficial influence of one's cosmological attunement. [ 155 ]\n",
      "Ziran ( 自然 ; zìrán ; tzu-jan ; lit. \"self-so\", \" self-organization \" [ 156 ] ) is regarded as a central concept and value in Taoism and as a way of flowing with the Tao. [ 157 ] [ 158 ] It describes the \"primordial state\" of all things [ 159 ] as well as a basic character of the Tao, [ 160 ] and is usually associated with spontaneity and creativity. [ 161 ] According to Kohn, in the Zhuangzi , ziran refers to the fact that \"there is thus no ultimate cause to make things what they are. The universe exists by itself and of itself; it is existence just as it is. Nothing can be added or substracted from it; it is entirely sufficient upon itself.\" [ 162 ]\n",
      "To attain naturalness, one has to identify with the Tao and flow with its natural rhythms as expressed in oneself. [ 160 ] [ 163 ] This involves freeing oneself from selfishness and desire, and appreciating simplicity. [ 157 ] It also involves understanding one's nature and living in accordance with it, without trying to be something one is not or overthinking one's experience. [ 164 ] One way of cultivating ziran found in the Zhuangzi is to practice the \"fasting of the mind\", a kind of Taoist meditation in which one empties the mind. It is held that this can also activate qi (vital energy). [ 165 ] In some passages found in the Zhuangzi and in the Tao Te Ching , naturalness is also associated with rejection of the state ( anarchism ) and a desire to return to simpler pre-technological times ( primitivism ). [ 166 ]\n",
      "An often cited metaphor for naturalness is pu ( 樸 ; pǔ, pú ; p'u ; 'uncut wood'), the \"uncarved log\", which represents the \"original nature... prior to the imprint of culture\" of an individual. [ 167 ] It is usually referred to as a state one may return to. [ 168 ]\n",
      "The term wu wei constitutes the leading ethical concept in Taoism. [ 169 ] Wei refers to any intentional or deliberated action, while wu carries the meaning of \"there is no ...\" or \"lacking, without\". Common translations are nonaction, effortless action, action without intent, noninterference and nonintervention. [ 170 ] [ 169 ] The meaning is sometimes emphasized by using the paradoxical expression \"wei wu wei\": action without action. [ 171 ] Kohn writes that wuwei refers to \"letting go of egoistic concerns\" and \"to abstain from forceful and interfering measures that cause tensions and disruption in favor of gentleness, adaptation, and ease.\" [ 158 ]\n",
      "In ancient Taoist texts, wu-wei is associated with water through its yielding nature and the effortless way it flows around obstacles. [ 172 ] Taoist philosophy, in accordance with the I Ching , proposes that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world in a manner that is out of rhythm with the cycles of change, they may disrupt that harmony and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than the willed outcome. [ 173 ] Thus the Tao Te Ching says: \"act of things and you will ruin them. Grasp for things and you will lose them. Therefore the sage acts with inaction and has no ruin, lets go of grasping and has no loss.\" [ 158 ]\n",
      "Taoism does not identify one's will as the root problem. Rather, it asserts that one must place their will in harmony with the natural way of the universe. [ 173 ] Thus, a potentially harmful interference may be avoided, and in this way, goals can be achieved effortlessly. [ 174 ] [ 175 ] \"By wu-wei, the sage seeks to come into harmony with the great Tao, which itself accomplishes by nonaction.\" [ 169 ]\n",
      "The Taoist view of the self is a holistic one that rejects the idea of a separate individualized self . As Russell Kirkland writes, Taoists \"generally assume that one's 'self' cannot be understood or fulfilled without reference to other persons, and to the broader set of realities in which all persons are naturally and properly embedded.\" [ 176 ]\n",
      "In Taoism, one's innate or fundamental nature (xing) is ultimately the Tao expressing or manifesting itself as an embodied person. Innate nature is connected with one's heartmind (xin), which refers to consciousness, the heart, and one's spirit. [ 155 ] The focus of Taoist psychology is the heartmind (xin) , the intellectual and emotional center (zhong) of a person. It is associated with the chest cavity, the physical heart as well as with emotions, thoughts, consciousness, and the storehouse of spirit (shen). [ 177 ] When the heartmind is unstable and separated from the Tao, it is called the ordinary heartmind (suxin). On the other hand, the original heartmind (benxin) pervades Tao and is constant and peaceful. [ 178 ]\n",
      "The Neiye (ch.14) calls this pure original heartmind the \"inner heartmind\", \"an awareness that precedes language\", and \"a lodging place of the numinous \". [ 179 ] Later Taoist sources also refer to it by other terms like \"awakened nature\" (wuxing), \"original nature\" (benxing), \"original spirit\" (yuanshen), and \"scarlet palace\". [ 180 ] This pure heartmind is seen as being characterized by clarity and stillness (qingjing), purity, pure yang, spiritual insight, and emptiness. [ 180 ]\n",
      "Taoists see life (sheng) as an expression of the Tao. The Tao is seen as granting each person a ming (life destiny), which is one's corporeal existence, one's body and vitality. [ 155 ] Generally speaking, Taoist cultivation seeks a holistic psychosomatic form of training that is described as \"dual cultivation of innate nature and life-destiny\" ( xingming shuanxiu ). [ 155 ] Taoism believes in a \"pervasive spirit world that is both interlocked with and separate from the world of humans.\" [ 181 ]\n",
      "The cultivation of innate nature is often associated with the practice of stillness (jinggong) or quiet meditation, while the cultivation of life-destiny generally revolves around movement based practices (dongong) like daoyin and health and longevity practices ( yangsheng ). [ 182 ]\n",
      "Many Taoist practices work with ancient Chinese understandings of the body, its organs and parts, \"elixir fields\" ( dantien ), inner substances (such as \"essence\" or jing), animating forces (like the hun and po ), and meridians ( qi channels). The complex Taoist schema of the body and its subtle body components contains many parallels with Traditional Chinese medicine and is used for health practices as well as for somatic and spiritual transformation (through neidan – \"psychosomatic transmutation\" or \"internal alchemy\"). [ 183 ] Taoist physical cultivation rely on purifying and transforming the body's qi (vital breath, energy) in various ways such as dieting and meditation. [ 184 ]\n",
      "According to Livia Kohn, qi is \"the cosmic energy that pervades all. The concrete aspect of Tao, qi is the material force of the universe, the basic stuff of nature.\" [ 185 ] According to the Zhuangzi, \"human life is the accumulation of qi; death is its dispersal.\" [ 185 ] Everyone has some amount of qi and can gain and lose qi in various ways. Therefore, Taoists hold that through various qi cultivation methods they can harmonize their qi, and thus improve health and longevity , and even attain magic powers, social harmony , and immortality. [ 184 ] The Neiye (Inward Training) is one of the earliest texts that teach qi cultivation methods. [ 186 ]\n",
      "Qi is one of the Three Treasures , which is a specifically Taoist schema of the main elements in Taoist physical practices like qigong and neidan . [ 187 ] The three are: jing (精, essence, the foundation for one's vitality), qi and shén (神, spirit, subtle consciousness, a capacity to connect with the subtle spiritual reality). [ 187 ] [ 188 ] [ 189 ] These three are further associated with the three \"elixir fields\" ( dantien ) and the organs in different ways. [ 190 ] [ 189 ]\n",
      "The body in Taoist political philosophy was important and their differing views on it and humanity's place in the universe were a point of distinction from Confucian politicians , writers , and political commentators . [ 191 ] Some Taoists viewed ancestors as merely corpses that were improperly revered and respect for the dead as irrelevant and others within groups that followed these beliefs viewed almost all traditions as worthless. [ 191 ]\n",
      "Daoist ethics tends to emphasize various themes from the Taoist classics, such as naturalness ( pu ), spontaneity ( ziran ), simplicity , detachment from desires , and most important of all, wu wei . [ 192 ] The classic Daoist view is that humans are originally and naturally aligned with Tao, thus their original nature is inherently good. It emphasizes doing things that are natural, following the Tao, which is a cosmic force that flows through all things and binds and releases them. [ 193 ] However, one can fall away from this due to personal habits, desires, and social conditions. Returning to one's nature requires active attunement through Daoist practice and ethical cultivation. [ 194 ]\n",
      "Some popular Daoist beliefs, such as the early Shangqing school , do not believe this and believe that some people are irredeemably evil and destined to be so. [ 195 ] Many Taoist movements from around the time Buddhist elements started being syncretized with Daoism had an extremely negative view of foreigners, referring to them as yi or \"barbarians\", and some of these thought of foreigners as people who do not feel \"human feelings\" and who never live out the correct norms of conduct until they became Taoist. [ 196 ] At this time, China was widely viewed by Taoists as a holy land because of influence from the Chinese public that viewed being born in China as a privilege and that outsiders were enemies. [ 196 ] Preserving a sense of \"Chineseness\" in the country and rewarding nativist policies such as the building of the Great Wall of China was important to many Taoist groups. [ 197 ]\n",
      "Foreigners who joined these Taoist sects were made to repent for their sins in another life that caused them to be born \"in the frontier wilds\" because of Buddhist ideas of reincarnation coming into their doctrines . [ 196 ] Some Daoist movements viewed human nature neutrally. [ 198 ] However, some of the movements that were dour or skeptical about human nature did not believe that evil is permanent and believed that evil people can become good. Korean Daoists tended to think extremely positively of human nature. [ 199 ]\n",
      "Some of the most important virtues in Taoism are the Three Treasures or Three Jewels ( 三寶 ; sānbǎo ). These are: ci ( 慈 ; cí , usually translated as compassion ), jian ( 儉 ; jiǎn , usually translated as moderation ), and bugan wei tianxia xian ( 不敢爲天下先 ; bùgǎn wéi tiānxià xiān ; 'not daring to act as first under the heavens', but usually translated as humility ). Arthur Waley , applying them to the socio-political sphere, translated them as: \"abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment\", \"absolute simplicity of living\", and \"refusal to assert active authority\". [ 200 ]\n",
      "Taoism also adopted the Buddhist doctrines of karma and reincarnation into its religious ethical system. [ 201 ] Medieval Taoist thought developed the idea that ethics was overseen by a celestial administration that kept records of people's actions and their fate, as well as handed out rewards and punishments through particular celestial administrators. [ 202 ]\n",
      "In its original form, the religion does not involve political affairs or complex rituals; on the contrary, it encourages the avoidance of public responsibility and the search for a vision of a spiritual transcendent world. [ 203 ] [ citation needed ]\n",
      "Taoists have different religious goals that include Taoist conceptions of sagehood ( zhenren ), spiritual self-cultivation, a happy afterlife or longevity and some form of immortality ( xian , variously understood as a kind of transcendent post-mortem state of the spirit). [ 204 ] [ 205 ]\n",
      "Taoists' views about what happens in the afterlife tend to include the soul becoming a part of the cosmos [ 206 ] (which was often thought of as an illusionary place where qi and physical matter were thought of as being the same in a way held together by the microcosm of the spirits of the human body and the macrocosm of the universe itself, represented and embodied by the Three Pure Ones ), [ 205 ] somehow aiding the spiritual functions of nature or Tian after death or being saved by either achieving spiritual immortality in an afterlife or becoming a xian who can appear in the human world at will, [ 207 ] but normally lives in another plane. \"[S]acred forests and[/or] mountains\" [ 208 ] or a yin-yang , [ 209 ] [ 210 ] yin, yang, or Tao realm [ 210 ] inconceivable and incomprehensible by normal humans and even the virtuous Confucius and Confucianists , [ 211 ] such as the mental realm sometimes called \"the Heavens \" where higher, spiritual versions of Daoists such as Laozi were thought to exist when they were alive and absorb \"the purest Yin and Yang\" [ 212 ] were all possibilities for a potential xian to be reborn in. These spiritual versions were thought to be abstract beings that can manifest in that world as mythical beings such as xian dragons who eat yin and yang energy and ride clouds and their qi . [ 212 ]\n",
      "More specifically, possibilities for \"the spirit of the body\" include \"join[ing] the universe after death\", [ 206 ] exploring [ 213 ] or serving various functions in parts of tiān [ 214 ] or other spiritual worlds, [ 213 ] [ 215 ] or becoming a xian who can do one or more of those things. [ 213 ] [ 214 ]\n",
      "Taoist xian are often seen as being eternally young because \"of their life being totally at one with the Tao of nature .\" [ 216 ] They are also often seen as being made up of \"pure breath and light\" and as being able to shapeshift , and some Taoists believed their afterlife natural \"paradises\" were palaces of heaven. [ 217 ]\n",
      "Taoists who sought to become one of the many different types of immortals, such as xian or zhenren , wanted to \"ensure complete physical and spiritual immortality\". [ 41 ]\n",
      "In the Quanzhen school of Wang Chongyang , the goal is to become a sage, which he equates with being a \"spiritual immortal\" ( shen xien ) and with the attainment of \"clarity and stillness\" ( qingjing ) through the integration of \"inner nature\" (xing) and \"worldly reality\" (ming). [ 218 ]\n",
      "Those who know the Tao, who flow with the natural way of the Tao and thus embody the patterns of the Tao are called sages or \"perfected persons\" ( zhenren ). [ 219 ] [ 220 ] This is what is often considered salvation in Taoist soteriology . [ 213 ] [ 221 ] [ 222 ] They often are depicted as living simple lives, as craftsmen or hermits . In other cases, they are depicted as the ideal rulers which practice ruling through non-intervention and under which nations prosper peacefully. [ 219 ] Sages are the highest humans, mediators between heaven and earth and the best guides on the Taoist path. They act naturally and simply, with a pure mind and with wuwei. They may have supernatural powers and bring good fortune and peace. [ 223 ]\n",
      "Some sages are also considered to have become one of the immortals (xian) through their mastery of the Tao. After shedding their mortal form, spiritual immortals may have many superhuman abilities like flight [ 215 ] and are often said to live in heavenly realms. [ 224 ] [ 213 ]\n",
      "The sages as thus because they have attained the primary goal of Taoism: a union with the Tao and harmonization or alignment with its patterns and flows. [ 225 ] This experience is one of being attuned to the Tao and to our own original nature, which already has a natural capacity for resonance ( ganying ) with Tao. [ 226 ] This is the main goal that all Daoist practices are aiming towards and can be felt in various ways, such as a sense of psychosomatic vitality and aliveness as well as stillness and a \"true joy\" (zhenle) or \"celestial joy\" that remains unaffected by mundane concerns like gain and loss. [ 227 ]\n",
      "The Taoist quest for immortality was inspired by Confucian emphasis on filial piety and how worshipped ancestors were thought to exist after death. [ 217 ]\n",
      "Becoming an immortal through the power of yin-yang and heaven, but also specifically Taoist interpretations of the Tao, was sometimes thought of as possible in Chinese folk religion , [ 210 ] and Taoist thoughts on immortality were sometimes drawn from Confucian views on heaven and its status as an afterlife that permeates the mortal world as well.\n",
      "Taoist cosmology is cyclic —the universe is seen as being in constant change, with various forces and energies (qi) affecting each other in different complex patterns. [ 228 ] [ 229 ] [ 156 ] Taoist cosmology shares similar views with the School of Naturalists . [ 5 ] Taoist cosmology focuses on the impersonal transformations (zaohua) of the universe, which are spontaneous and unguided. [ 230 ]\n",
      "Livia Kohn explains the basic Taoist cosmological theory as: [ 231 ]\n",
      "the root of creation Tao rested in deep chaos (ch. 42). Next, it evolved into the One, a concentrated state cosmic unity that is full of creative potential and often described in I Ching terms as the taiji . The One then brought forth \"the Two\", the two energies yin and yang, which in turn merged in harmony to create the next level of existence, \"the Three\" (yin-yang combined), from which the myriad beings came forth. From original oneness, the world thus continued to move into ever greater states of distinction and differentiation.\n",
      "The main distinction in Taoist cosmology is that between yin and yang , which applies to various sets of complementary ideas: bright – dark, light – heavy, soft – hard, strong – weak, above – below, ruler – minister, male – female, and so on. [ 232 ] Cosmically, these two forces exist in mutual harmony and interdependence. [ 233 ] Yin and yang are further divided into five phases ( Wu Xing , or five materials): minor yang, major yang, yin/yang, minor yin, major yin. Each of these correlates with a specific substance: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water respectively. [ 234 ] This schema is used in many different ways in Taoist thought and practice, from nourishing life ( yangsheng ) and medicine to astrology and divination. [ 235 ]\n",
      "Taoists also generally see all things as being animated and constituted by qi (vital air, subtle breath), which is seen as a force that circulates throughout the universe and throughout human bodies (as both air in the lungs and as a subtle breath throughout the body's meridians and organs). [ 236 ] Qi is in constant transformation between its condensed state (life) and diluted state (potential). [ 237 ] These two different states of qi are embodiments of yin and yang, [ 237 ] two complementary forces that constantly play against and with each other and where one cannot exist without the other. [ 238 ]\n",
      "Taoist texts present various creation stories and cosmogonies . Classic cosmogonies are nontheistic , presenting a natural undirected process in which an apophatic undifferentiated potentiality (called wuwuji, \"without non-differentiation\") naturally unfolds into wuji (primordial oneness, \"non-differentiation\"), which then evolves into yin-yang ( taiji ) and then into the myriad beings, as in the Tao Te Ching . [ 239 ] [ 240 ] Later medieval models included the idea of a creator God (mainly seen as Lord Lao), representing order and creativity. [ 239 ] Taoist cosmology influences Taoist soteriology, which holds that one can \"return to the root\" (guigen) of the universe (and of ourselves), which is also the Tao—the impersonal source (yuan) of all things. [ 241 ]\n",
      "In Taoism, human beings are seen as a microcosm of the universe, [ 27 ] and thus the cosmological forces, like the five phases, are also present in the form of the zang-fu organs. [ 242 ] Another common belief is that there are various gods that reside in human bodies. [ 243 ] As a consequence, it is believed that a deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself. [ 244 ]\n",
      "Another important element of Taoist cosmology is the use of Chinese astrology . [ 228 ]\n",
      "Taoist theology can be defined as apophatic , given its philosophical emphasis on the formlessness and unknowable nature of the Tao, and the primacy of the \"Way\" rather than anthropomorphic concepts of God . Nearly all the sects share this core belief. [ 63 ]\n",
      "Arguments do exist the monotheistic concepts in Taoism. [ 245 ] However, Taoism does include many deities and spirits and thus can also be considered animistic and polytheistic in a secondary sense (since they are considered to be emanations from the impersonal and nameless ultimate principle). [ 246 ] Some Taoist theology presents the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon of deities, which was a hierarchy emanating from the Tao. [ 247 ] Laozi (Lao Tzu) is considered the incarnation of one of the three and worshiped as the ancestral founder of Taoism. [ 248 ] [ 249 ]\n",
      "The gods and immortals ( 神仙 ) believed in by Taoism can be roughly divided into two categories, namely \"gods\" and \"xian\". \"Gods\" refers to deities and there are many kinds: heaven gods/celestials ( 天神 ); earth spirits ( 地祇 ); wuling ( 物靈 , animism , the spirit of all things); netherworld gods ( 地府神靈 ); gods of the human body ( 人體之神 ); gods of the human ghost ( 人鬼之神 ) etc. \"Xian\" are those who have acquired perfect cultivation of the Tao, persons with vast supernatural powers, unpredictable changes and immortality. [ 6 ]\n",
      "Different branches of Taoism often have differing pantheons of lesser deities, where these deities reflect different notions of cosmology. [ 250 ] Lesser deities also may be promoted or demoted for their activity. [ 251 ] Some varieties of popular Chinese religion incorporate the Jade Emperor ( Yü-Huang or Yü-Di ), one of the Three Pure Ones, as the highest God. Historical Taoist figures, and people who are considered to have become immortals ( xian ), are also venerated as well by both clergy and laypeople. [ 252 ]\n",
      "Despite these hierarchies of deities, most conceptions of Tao should not be confused with the Western sense of theism . [ further explanation needed ] Being one with the Tao does not necessarily indicate a union with an eternal spirit in, for example, the Hindu theistic sense. [ 253 ] [ 173 ]\n",
      "Some key elements of Taoist practice include a commitment to self-cultivation, wu wei, and attunement to the patterns of the Tao. [ 254 ] The practice of Taoism seeks to develop the body back to its original level of energy and restore it to its original state of creation. The body is no longer just a means of living in harmony in the world, it is itself a universe. [ 255 ] Most Taoists throughout history have agreed on the importance of self cultivation through various practices, which were seen as ways to transform oneself and integrate oneself to the deepest realities. [ 256 ]\n",
      "Communal rituals are important in most Taoist traditions, as are methods of self-cultivation. Taoist self-cultivation practices tend to focus on the transformation of the heartmind together with bodily substances and energies (like jing and qi ) and their connection to natural and universal forces, patterns, and powers. [ 257 ]\n",
      "Despite the detachment from reality and dissent from Confucian humanism that the Tao Te Ching teaches, Taoists were and are generally not misanthropes or nihilists and see humans as an important class of things in the world. [ 198 ] However, in most Taoist views humans were not held to be especially important in comparison to other aspects of the world and Taoist metaphysics that were seen as equally or more special. [ 198 ] Similarly, some Taoists had similar views on their gods or the gods of other religions. [ 52 ]\n",
      "According to Louis Komjathy, Taoist practice is a diverse and complex subject that can include \"aesthetics, art, dietetics, ethics, health and longevity practice, meditation, ritual, seasonal attunement, scripture study, and so forth.\" [ 254 ]\n",
      "Throughout the history of Taoism, mountains have occupied a special place for Taoist practice. They are seen as sacred spaces and as the ideal places for Taoist cultivation and Taoist monastic or eremitic life, which may include \"cloud wandering\" (yunyou) in the mountains and dwelling in mountain hermitages (an) or grottoes (dong). [ 258 ]\n",
      "Tao can serve as a life energy instead of qi in some Taoist belief systems. [ citation needed ]\n",
      "One of the earliest schemas for Taoist practice was the \"nine practices\" or \"nine virtues\" (jiǔxíng 九行), which were taught in the Celestial Masters school. These were drawn from classic Taoist sources, mainly the Tao Te Ching , and are presented in the Laojun jinglu ( Scriptural Statutes of Lord Lao ; DZ 786). [ 259 ]\n",
      "The nine practices are: [ 260 ]\n",
      "Ancient Chinese religion made much use of sacrifices to gods and ancestors, which could include slaughtered animals (such as pigs and ducks) or fruit. The Taoist Celestial Master Zhang Daoling rejected food and animal sacrifices to the gods. Today, many Taoist temples reject animal sacrifice. [ 261 ] Sacrifices to the deities remains a key element of Taoist rituals however. There are various kinds of Taoist rituals, which may include presenting offerings, scripture reading, sacrifices, incantations, purification rites, confession, petitions and announcements to the gods, observing the ethical precepts, memorials, chanting, lectures, and communal feasts. [ 262 ] [ 263 ]\n",
      "On particular holidays, such as the Qingming/Ching Ming festival , street parades take place. These are lively affairs that involve firecrackers, the burning of hell money , and flower-covered floats broadcasting traditional music. They also variously include lion dances and dragon dances , human-occupied puppets (often of the \"Seventh Lord\" and \"Eighth Lord\" ), gongfu , and palanquins carrying images of deities. The various participants are not considered performers, but rather possessed by the gods and spirits in question. [ 264 ]\n",
      "Taking up and living by sets of ethical precepts is another important practice in Taoism. By the Tang dynasty , Taoism had created a system of lay discipleship in which one took a set of Ten precepts (Taoism) .\n",
      "The Five precepts (Taoism) are identical to the Buddhist five precepts (which are to avoid: killing [both human and non-human animals], theft, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxicants like alcohol .) The other five were a set of five injunctions: [ 79 ]\n",
      "(6) I will maintain harmony with my ancestors and family and never disregard my kin; (7) When I see someone do good, I will support him with joy and delight; (8) When I see someone unfortunate, I will support him with dignity to recover good fortune; (9) When someone comes to do me harm, I will not harbor thoughts of revenge; (10) As long as all beings have not attained the Dao, I will not expect to do so myself.\n",
      "Apart from these common ethical precepts, Taoist traditions also have larger sets of precepts that are often reserved for ordained priests or monastics.\n",
      "A key part of many Taoist traditions is the practice of divination . There are many methods used by Chinese Taoists including I Ching divination, Chinese astrological divination, feng shui ( geomantic divination), and the interpretation of various omens . [ 265 ] [ 266 ]\n",
      "Mediumship and exorcism is a key element of some Taoist traditions. These can include tongji mediumship and the practice of planchette writing or spirit writing. [ 266 ]\n",
      "Taoist longevity methods are closely related to ancient Chinese medicine . Many of these methods date back to Tang dynasty figures like alchemist Sun Simiao (582–683) and the Highest Clarity Patriarch Sima Chengzhen (647–735). [ 267 ] The goal of these methods range from better health and longevity to immortality. Key elements of these \"nourishing life\" ( yangsheng ) methods include: moderation in all things (drink, food, etc.), adapting to the cycles of the seasons by following injunctions regarding healing exercises ( daoyin ), and breathwork . [ 268 ]\n",
      "A number of physical practices, like modern forms of qigong , as well as modern internal martial arts ( neijia ) like Taijiquan , Baguazhang , Xingyiquan , and Liuhebafa , are practiced by Taoists as methods of cultivating health and longevity as well as eliciting internal alchemical transformations. [ 269 ] [ 270 ] [ 271 ] However, these methods are not specifically Taoist and are often practiced outside of Taoist contexts. [ 272 ]\n",
      "Another key longevity method is \"ingestion\", which focuses on what one absorbs or consumes from one's environment and is seen as affecting what one becomes. [ 273 ] Diatectics, closely influenced by Chinese medicine, is a key element of ingestion practice, and there are numerous Taoist diet regimens for different effects (such as ascetic diets, monastic diets, therapeutic diets, and alchemical diets that use herbs and minerals). [ 274 ] One common practice is the avoidance of grains (bigu) . [ 275 ] In certain cases, practices like vegetarianism and true fasting is also adopted (which may also be termed bigu ). [ 276 ]\n",
      "Some Taoists thought of the human body as a spiritual nexus with thousands of shen [ 189 ] (often 36,000), [ 277 ] gods who were likely thought of as at least somewhat mental in nature because of the word's other meaning of consciousness, that could be communed with by doing various methods to manipulate the yin and yang of the body, as well as its qi. [ 189 ] These Taoists also thought of the human body as a metaphorical existence where three \" cinnabar fields\" [ 189 ] that represented a higher level of reality or a spiritual kind of cinnabar that does not exist in normal reality. A method of meditation used by these Taoists was \"visualizing light\" that was thought to be qi or another kind of life energy a Taoist substituted for qi [ 189 ] or believed in the existence of instead. The light was then channeled through the three cinnabar fields, forming a \"microcosmic orbit\" or through the hands and feet for a \"macrocosmic orbit\". [ 189 ]\n",
      "The 36,000 shen regulated the body and bodily functions through a bureaucratic system \"modeled after the Chinese system of government\". [ 277 ] Death occurs only when these gods leave, but life can be extended by meditating while visualizing them, doing good deeds, and avoiding meat and wine . [ 277 ]\n",
      "There are many methods of Taoist meditation (often referred to as \"stillness practice\", jinggong ), some of which were strongly influenced by Buddhist methods . [ 267 ] [ 271 ]\n",
      "Some of the key forms of Taoist meditation are: [ 278 ] [ 271 ]\n",
      "A key element of many schools of Taoism are alchemical practices, which include rituals, meditations, exercises, and the creation of various alchemical substances. The goals of alchemy include physical and spiritual transformation, aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces, undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys, improving physical health, extending one's life, and even becoming an immortal ( xian ). [ 285 ]\n",
      "Taoist alchemy can be found in early Taoist scriptures like the Taiping Jing and the Baopuzi . [ 286 ] There are two main kinds of alchemy, internal alchemy ( neidan ) and external alchemy ( waidan ). Internal alchemy (neidan, literally: \"internal elixir\"), which focuses on the transformation and increase of qi in the body, developed during the late imperial period (especially during the Tang) and is found in almost all Taoist schools today, though it is most closely associated with the Quanzhen School . [ 287 ] [ 288 ] There are many systems of internal alchemy with different methods such as visualization and breathwork. [ 287 ] In the late Imperial period, neidan developed into complex systems that drew on numerous elements, including: classic Taoist texts and meditations, yangsheng , I Ching symbology, Taoist cosmology, external alchemy concepts and terms, Chinese medicine , and Buddhist influences. [ 289 ] Neidan systems tend to be passed on through oral master-disciple lineages that are often to be secret. [ 282 ]\n",
      "Livia Kohn writes that the main goal of internal alchemy is generally understood as a set of three transformations: \"from essence (jing) to energy ( qi ), from energy to spirit (shen), and from spirit to Dao.\" [ 290 ] Common methods for this include engaging the subtle body and activating the microcosmic orbit . [ 290 ] [ 282 ] [ 189 ] Louis Komjathy adds that neidan seeks to create a transcendent spirit, usually called the \"immortal embryo\" (xiantai) or \"yang spirit\" (yangshen). [ 289 ]\n",
      "Some religious Taoist movements view traditional texts as scriptures that are considered sacred, authoritative, binding, and divinely inspired or revealed. [ 291 ] [ 292 ] [ 293 ] However, the Tao Te Ching was originally viewed as \"human wisdom\" and \"written by humans for humans.\" [ 293 ] It and other important texts \"acquired authority...that caused them to be regarded...as sacred.\" [ 293 ]\n",
      "Perhaps the most influential texts are the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi . [ 294 ] [ 295 ]\n",
      "Throughout the history of Taoism, the Tao Te Ching has been a central text, used for ritual, self-cultivation, and philosophical purposes. [ 296 ] [ 297 ]\n",
      "According to legend, the Tao Te Ching (also known as the Laozi ) was written by Laozi . [ 298 ] Authorship, precise date of origin, and even unity of the text are still subject of debate [ 299 ] and will probably never be known with certainty. [ 300 ] The earliest manuscripts of this work (written on bamboo tablets ) date back to the late 4th century BCE, and these contain significant differences from the later received edition (of Wang Bi c. 226 –249). [ 301 ] [ 302 ] Apart from the Guodian text and the Wang Bi edition, another alternative version exists, the Mawangdui Tao Te Chings. [ 303 ]\n",
      "Louis Komjathy writes that the Tao Te Ching is \"actually a multi-vocal anthology consisting of a variety of historical and textual layers; in certain respects, it is a collection of oral teachings of various members of the inner cultivation lineages.\" [ 297 ] Meanwhile, Russell Kirkland argues that the text arose out of \"various traditions of oral wisdom\" from the state of Chu that were written, circulated, edited, and rewritten by different hands. He also suggests that authors from the Jixia academy may have been involved in the editing process. [ 304 ]\n",
      "The Tao Te Ching is not organized in any clear fashion and is a collection of different sayings on various themes. [ 305 ] The leading themes of the Tao Te Ching revolve around the nature of Tao, how to attain it and De, the inner power of Tao, as well as the idea of wei wu-wei . [ 306 ] [ 307 ] Tao is said to be ineffable and accomplishes great things through small, lowly, effortless, and \"feminine\" (yin) ways (which are compared to the behavior of water). [ 306 ] [ 307 ]\n",
      "Ancient commentaries on the Tao Te Ching are important texts in their own right. Perhaps the oldest one, the Heshang Gong commentary, was most likely written in the 2nd century CE. [ 308 ] Other important commentaries include the one from Wang Bi and the Xiang'er commentary. [ 309 ]\n",
      "The Zhuangzi ( Book of Master Zhuang , 莊子 ), named after its supposed author Zhuang Zhou , is a highly influential composite text of multi-vocal writings from various sources and historical periods. [ 310 ] The commentator and editor Guo Xiang (c. CE 300) helped establish the text as an important source for Taoist thought. One traditional view is that a sage called Zhuang Zhou wrote the first seven chapters (the \"inner chapters\"), and his students and related thinkers were responsible for the other parts (the outer and miscellaneous chapters). However, some modern scholars, like Russell Kirkland, argue that Guo Xiang is actually the creator of the 33-chapter Zhuangzi text and that there is no solid historical data for the existence of Zhuang Zhou himself (other than the sparse and unreliable mentions in Sima Qian ). [ 311 ] Zhuangzi also introduced seven versions of the meeting between Laozi and Confucius. Laozi is portrayed as growing old, and his Taoist teachings confuse his famous interlocutors. Zhuangzi also provides the only record of Laozi's death. [ 312 ]\n",
      "The Zhuangzi uses anecdotes, parables, and dialogues to express one of its main themes—avoiding cultural constructs and instead living in a spontaneous way aligned with the natural world. [ 313 ] [ 314 ] This way of living might be perceived as \"useless\" by most people who follow their own \"common sense\" and social and political rules, but this uselessness is actually a wiser alternative, since it is more in accord with reality. [ 315 ]\n",
      "Taoism draws on numerous Chinese classics that are not themselves \"Taoist\" texts but that remain important sources for Taoists. Perhaps the most important of these is the ancient divination text called the Yijing (circa 1150 BCE). [ 316 ] The divination method in the Yijing and its associated concepts of yin and yang mapped into 64 \" hexagrams \"—combinations of the 8 trigrams —has influenced Taoism from its inception until today. [ 317 ] [ 318 ]\n",
      "Taoism also drew on other non-Taoist Chinese classic texts including: [ 44 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]\n",
      "There are many other important Taoist texts, including:\n",
      "The Taoist Canon ( 道藏 , Treasury of Tao ) is also referred to as the Daozang . It was originally compiled during the Jin , Tang , and Song dynasties. The extant version was published during the Ming dynasty . [ 329 ] The Ming Daozang includes almost 1,500 texts . [ 330 ] Following the example of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka , it is divided into three dong ( 洞 , \"caves\" or \"grottoes\"). They are arranged from \"highest\" to \"lowest\": [ 331 ]\n",
      "Taoist generally do not consult published versions of the Daozang, but individually choose or inherit texts included in the Daozang. These texts have been passed down for generations from teacher to student. [ 332 ]\n",
      "The Shangqing School has a tradition of approaching Taoism through scriptural study. It is believed that by reciting certain texts often enough one will be rewarded with immortality. [ 333 ]\n",
      "The taijitu , commonly known as the \"yin and yang symbol\" or simply the \"yin-yang\", and the bagua are important symbols in Taoism because they represent key elements of Taoist cosmology (see above). [ 334 ] [ 335 ] Many Taoist (as well as non-Taoist) organizations make use of these symbols, and they may appear on flags and logos, temple floors, or stitched into clerical robes. What has become the standardised yin-yang taijitu originated as a Taoist symbol in the 10th century CE during the early Song dynasty . [ 336 ]\n",
      "The tiger and dragon are more ancient symbols for yin and yang respectively, and these two animals are still widely used in Taoist art. [ 336 ] Taoist temples in southern China and Taiwan may often be identified by their roofs, which feature dragons , tigers, and phoenixes (with the phoenix also standing for yin) made from multicolored ceramic tiles. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures. [ 337 ]\n",
      "Taoist temples may fly square or triangular flags. They typically feature mystical writing, talismans, or diagrams and are intended to fulfill various functions including providing guidance for the spirits of the dead, bringing good fortune, increasing life span, etc. [ 338 ] Other flags and banners may be those of the gods or immortals themselves. [ 339 ]\n",
      "Drawings of the Big Dipper (also called the Bushel) are also important symbols. [ 340 ] In the Shang dynasty of the 2nd millennium BCE, Chinese thought regarded the Big Dipper as a deity, while, in later periods, it came to symbolize Taiji . [ 341 ] [ 340 ] A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which stands for the pole star and may be seen on such roofs between two dragons as well as on the hairpin of a Celestial Master . [ 342 ] [ 340 ]\n",
      "Some Taoists saw the stars as \"knots in the 'net of Heaven'\" that connected everything in \"heaven and earth\". [ 343 ]\n",
      "Many Taoists saw the Tao as \"the [metaphorical] pearl of the sage\" and a \"conjunction between yin...[and] yang.\" [ 344 ] Taoists also revered pearls more generally, seeing lung dragon celestials as emerging from the glint of light off of a pearl that existed \"in the mists of chaos\" and trapped in an endless cycle where they continually retrieve the pearl that makes them out of the mists. [ 345 ] Some Internal Alchemy Taoists worshipped mercury as \"divine water\" and an embodiment of consciousness that was a \"flowing pearl\". [ 345 ]\n",
      "In the later Qing dynasty , Taoists and intellectuals who leaned towards Taoism used the wuxing as symbols of leadership and good governance, using old religious texts and various historiographies made in prior dynasties to assign a phase from the five wuxing to different Chinese dynasties. [ 346 ]\n",
      "Symbols that represent longevity and immortality are particularly popular, and these include: cranes , pine trees, and the peaches of immortality (associated with the Queen Mother of the West ). [ 340 ] Natural symbols are also common, and include gourds, caves, clouds, mountains, and the animals of the Chinese zodiac. [ 340 ] Other symbols used by Taoists include: the Yellow River Map , the Luoshu Square , I Ching coins, Taoist talismans ( fulu ), the Four Symbols (mythical creatures) , and various Chinese characters (such as the character for Tao and the shou ('longevity') character).\n",
      "Taoist priests also wear distinctive robes, such as the Daojiao fushi and Taoist versions of the Daopao , which symbolize their status and school affiliation.\n",
      "Taoist communities can include a wide variety of people and groups, including daoshi, hermits , monastics, teachers, householders, ascetics, family lineages, teacher-disciple lineages, urban associations, temples, and monasteries. [ 347 ]\n",
      "According to Russell Kirkland, throughout most of its history, most Taoist traditions \"were founded and maintained by aristocrats or by members of the later well-to-do ' gentry ' class\". [ 348 ] The only real exception is the Celestial Masters movement, which had a strong basis in the lower classes (though even this movement had a hereditary leadership made up of figures of the Chang clan for generations). [ 348 ]\n",
      "The number of Taoists is difficult to estimate, due to a variety of factors, including defining Taoism. According to a survey of religion in China in 2010, the number of people practicing some form of Chinese folk religion is near to 950 million, which is 70% of Chinese. [ 349 ] Among these, 173 million (13%) claim an affiliation with Taoist practices. [ 349 ] 12 million people stated that they were \"Taoists\", a term traditionally used exclusively for initiates, priests, and experts of Taoist rituals and methods. [ 349 ]\n",
      "Since the creation of the People's Republic of China, the government has encouraged a revival of Taoist traditions in codified settings. In 1956, the Chinese Taoist Association was formed to administer the activities of all registered Taoist orders, and received official approval in 1957. [ 350 ]\n",
      "It was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution under Mao Zedong , but was reestablished in 1980. The headquarters of the association are at the Baiyunguan , or White Cloud Temple of Beijing , belonging to the Longmen branch of the Quanzhen tradition. [ 350 ] Since 1980, many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt, both belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen schools, and clergy ordination has been resumed.\n",
      "Taoist literature and art has influenced the cultures of Korea , Japan , and Vietnam . Organized Taoism seems not to have attracted a large non-Chinese following until modern times. In Taiwan, 7.5 million people, 33% of the population, identify themselves as Taoists. [ 351 ] Data collected in 2010 for religious demographics of Hong Kong [ 352 ] and Singapore [ 353 ] show that, respectively, 14% and 11% of the people of these cities identify as Taoists.\n",
      "Followers of Daoism are present in Chinese émigré communities outside Asia. It has attracted followers with no Chinese heritage. For example, in Brazil there are Daoist temples in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro that are affiliated with the Taoist Society of China. Membership of these temples is entirely of non-Chinese ancestry. [ 354 ]\n",
      "Throughout Chinese history, there have been many examples of art being influenced by Taoism. [ 36 ] Notable painters influenced by Taoism include Wu Wei , Huang Gongwang , Mi Fu , Muqi Fachang , Shitao , Ni Zan , Tang Mi, and Wang Zengzu. [ 355 ] Taoist arts and belles-lettres represents the different regions, dialects, and time spans that are commonly associated with Taoism. Ancient Taoist art was commissioned by the aristocracy; however, scholars masters and adepts also directly engaged in the art themselves. [ 356 ]\n",
      "Taoism never had a unified political theory. While Huang–Lao positions justified a strong emperor as the legitimate ruler, [ 357 ] the Taoist \"primitivists\" (of chapters 8–11 of the Zhuangzi ) argued for a kind of anarchism . A more moderate position is presented in the Inner Chapters of the Zhuangzi in which the political life is presented with disdain and some kind of pluralism or perspectivism is preferred. [ 358 ]\n",
      "The syncretist position found in texts like the Huainanzi and some of the Outer Chapters of the Zhuangzi blend Taoist positions with Confucian views. [ 359 ]\n",
      "Many scholars believe Taoism arose as a countermovement to Confucianism . [ 360 ] The philosophical terms Tao and De are indeed shared by both Taoism and Confucianism. [ 361 ] Zhuangzi explicitly criticized Confucian and Mohist tenets in his work. In general, Taoism rejects the Confucian emphasis on rituals , hierarchical social order, and conventional morality, and favors \"naturalness\", spontaneity, and individualism instead. [ 7 ]\n",
      "The entry of Buddhism into China was marked by significant interaction and syncretism with Taoism. [ 362 ] Originally seen as a kind of \"foreign Taoism\", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary. [ 363 ] Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism , like Sengzhao and Tao Sheng , knew and were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone texts. [ 364 ]\n",
      "Taoism especially shaped the development of Chan Buddhism , [ 365 ] [ 314 ] introducing elements like the concept of naturalness , distrust of scripture and text, and emphasis on embracing \"this life\" and living in the \"every-moment\". [ 366 ] Zhuangzi's statements that the Tao was omnipresent and that creation escorts animals and humans to death influenced Chinese Buddhist practitioners and scholars, especially Chan Buddhists. [ 314 ] On the other hand, Taoism also incorporated Buddhist elements during the Tang dynasty. Examples of such influence include monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of emptiness, and collecting scripture in tripartite organization in certain sects. [ citation needed ]\n",
      "Ideological and political rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism,Hinduism and Buddhism deeply influenced one another. [ 367 ] For example, Wang Bi , one of the most influential philosophical commentators on Laozi (and the I Ching ), was a Confucian. [ 368 ] The three rivals also share some similar values, with all three embracing a humanist philosophy emphasizing moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously. [ 369 ] This became institutionalized when aspects of the three schools were synthesized in the Neo-Confucian school. [ 370 ]\n",
      "Christian and Taoist contact often took place in the Tang dynasty, [ 371 ] and some scholars believe that the Church of the East influenced Taoist thought on the Three Pure Ones . [ 372 ] Emperor Taizong encouraged this, and Taoists who agreed with him and his laws incorporated elements of Christianity, Islam , Manichaeism , Judaism , Confucianism , and Buddhism into their faith. [ 371 ]\n",
      "Comparisons between Taoism and Epicureanism have focused on the absence of a creator or gods controlling the forces of nature in both. [ 373 ] Lucretius ' poem De rerum natura describes a naturalist cosmology where there are only atoms and void (a primal duality which mirrors yin-yang in its dance of assertion/yielding), and where nature takes its course with no gods or masters. Other parallels include the similarities between Daoist wu wei (effortless action) and Epicurean lathe biosas (live in obscurity), focus on naturalness ( ziran ) as opposed to conventional virtues, and the prominence of the Epicurus-like Chinese sage Yang Chu in the foundational Taoist writings.\n",
      "Some authors have undertaken comparative studies of Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of the history of religion such as J. J. M. de Groot , [ 374 ] among others. A comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth has been made by several authors, such as Martin Aronson, [ 375 ] and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that there are parallels that should not be ignored. [ 376 ] In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto, the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Daoism does not. [ 377 ] Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang , [ 378 ] have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of the religions are similar. [ 379 ] [ 380 ] In neighboring Vietnam , Taoist values have been shown to adapt to social norms and formed emerging sociocultural beliefs together with Confucianism. It also imitates some Hinduism concept. [ 381 ]\n",
      "Today, there are various living Taoist traditions, the largest and most influential are the Quanzhen School , particularly the Dragon Gate sect, and Zhengyi Dao . [ 382 ] Quanzhen lineages are mainly monastic and ascetic tradition, based on meditation and internal cultivation, while the Orthodox Unity tradition is based on a lay priests (daoshi) who are expected to master an extensive ritual repertoire. [ 383 ] These two traditions developed during the Song dynasty and grew to become recognized by the imperial government during late imperial China. [ 383 ]\n",
      "\"Some sects are concerned with the ritual control of spirits and the cosmic currents of yin and yang; others specialize in inner disciplines of meditation or breath control and mind-body exercise regimes.\" [ 384 ]\n",
      "There are also various smaller Taoist groups and traditions of practice. [ 127 ] Eva Wong divides the major \"systems\" of Taoism into the following categories: Magical Taoism, Divinational Taoism, Ceremonial Taoism, Internal-Alchemical Taoism and Action and Karma Taoism. [ 385 ]\n",
      "Magical Taoism is one of the oldest systems of Taoism and its practices are similar to the shamans and sorcerers of ancient China. [ 386 ] Magical Taoism believes there are various natural powers, deities and spirits (benevolent and malevolent) in the universe that can be made use of by specialists who know the right methods. [ 213 ] [ 215 ] Their magic can include rainmaking , protection, exorcism , healing, traveling to the underworld to help the dead and mediumship . [ 386 ]\n",
      "Protection magic can include the use of amulets and fulu , as well as specific rites. [ 387 ] Protection rites often include ritual petitions to the celestial deities of the northern bushel. [ 388 ] Divination is also a widespread practice. A commonly used method of divination in magical Taoism is sandwriting ( planchette writing). [ 389 ]\n",
      "According to Eva Wong, the main sects of magical Taoism today are the Maoshan sect (a very secretive sect, not to be confused with Shangqing ), the Celestial Masters and the Kun-Lun sect (which is strongly influenced by Tibetan magic and make use of Taoist and Buddhist deities ). [ 390 ]\n",
      "Divinational Taoism focuses on various divination techniques to help one predict the future and live accordingly. This practice can also carry deeper spiritual significance, since it can help one appreciate the flux of the Tao. [ 391 ] This form of Taoism owes much to the ancient fang-shih , the Yin and yang school of thought and often relies on the classic Chinese divination text, the Yijing . [ 392 ]\n",
      "This tradition also relies on the cosmology of Wuji and Taiji , along with the teachings of yin and yang, the five elements and the Chinese calendar . [ 393 ] There many forms of Daoist divination, they include: celestial divination (which include various systems of Chinese astrology , like Tzu-wei tu-su), terrestrial divination ( feng shui ), the casting of incense sticks with hexagrams on them and the interpretation of omens . [ 265 ]\n",
      "Contemporary divinational Taoism is practiced in temples and monasteries by various individuals and may not be sect specific (it is even practiced by non-daoists). [ 394 ] This Taoist practice can be found in the Mao-shan sorcerers, the Celestial Masters sect and the Dragon Gate Taoism and Wudang Mountains sects. [ 394 ] There are also many lay practitioners that are not affiliated with any specific sect. These lay Taoist practitioners are called \"kui-shih\". [ 395 ]\n",
      "Ceremonial Taoism focuses on ritual and devotion towards various celestial deities and spirits. The basic belief of ceremonial Taoism is that through various rites, human beings can honor the deities and these deities may then grant them with power, protection and blessings. [ 262 ] Rituals and festivals can include chanting, offerings, and the reading of scripture. [ 262 ] These rites are mostly performed by ritual masters who have trained extensively for this role and who may, through their mastery of ritual, intercede on behalf of laypersons. [ 396 ]\n",
      "There are various kinds of festivals in Ceremonial Taoism, including \"Great Services\" (chai-chiao) and Ritual Gatherings (fa-hui) that can last for days and can focus on repentance, rainmaking, disaster aversion or petitioning. [ 397 ] There are feast days which honor specific deities. 164 Funerals and birthday blessings are a common service. [ 398 ]\n",
      "There is a complex and large pantheon in Taoism. It includes various deities classified into various ranks within an administrative structure, at the top of which are the celestial lords (t'ien-tsun). These include judges, heralds, officers, generals, clerks and messengers. [ 399 ] The main division is between \"earlier heaven\" deities, who have existed since the beginning of time and \"later heaven\" deities, mortals who later became immortal. [ 400 ]\n",
      "146 Key earlier heaven deities include the Three Pure Ones , the Jade Emperor , the Queen Mother of the West , the Mother of the Bushel of Stars , the Seven Star Lords of the Northern Bushel and the Three Officials (Celestial, Earth, and Water). [ 400 ] Some key later heaven deities include: Immortal Lu Tung-pin , and Emperor Kuan (Kuan-yu) . [ 401 ] Taoists may also honor local spirits and deities, as well Buddhist deities (like Guanyin , Amitabha , etc.). [ 402 ]\n",
      "The largest and most prominent sect of Ceremonial Taoism is the Way of the Celestial Masters, also known as Zhengyi Dao . [ 398 ] The patriarch of this sect resides in Taiwan and this tradition performs numerous ceremonies which are often sponsored by the Taiwanese government. [ 398 ] The training for Zhengyi priesthood, who are not celibate, focuses mainly on learning extensive rituals and liturgy, so that they can perform them flawlessly. [ 403 ]\n",
      "Ceremonies are practiced, to a lesser extent, in the Longmen (Dragon Gate) sect of the Quanzhen School and in the Xiantiandao sect, though these schools understand ritual as mainly a way to develop internal alchemy. [ 403 ] During the Song dynasty, a popular form of ceremonial Taoism was the Thunder Rites (leifa), which focused on exorcism and protection. [ 87 ]\n",
      "Internal Alchemy Taoism or Transformation Taoism focuses on internal transformation through the use of various self-cultivation techniques like qigong , neidan (internal alchemy), Yangsheng and so forth. [ 404 ]\n",
      "The basic worldview of this Taoist tradition is that all beings are born with certain forms of energy (mainly the three treasures of jing, qi and shen), which become dissipated, weak and lost as we age. [ 405 ] To prevent this and to increase our inner vital energies, one must practice various methods of \"internal alchemy\" (neidan) to harmonize the internal energy in one's body and refine the \"golden elixir\" (jindan) inside the body. These meditative inner alchemical practices are believed to lead to greater longevity and even immortality (union with the Tao at death). [ 406 ]\n",
      "Another worldview is that beings must \"harmonize yin and yang forces internally to achieve immortality.\" [ 384 ] [ 407 ] A term used by some Taoists that sums up traditions that do not use these practices is \"singular path\". [ 407 ] Most traditions follow the \"singular path\". These include the Longmen ( Dragon Gate ) sect of the Quanzhen School , the Xiantiandao (Earlier Heaven Way) sect, the Wuliupai sect, and the Wudang quan sect. [ 408 ]\n",
      "The Quanzhen School was founded by Wang Chongyang (1112–1170), a hermit in the Zhongnan mountains who was said in legends to have met and learned secret methods from two immortals: Lu Dongbin and Zhongli Quan . [ 89 ] He then moved to Shandong and preached his teachings, founding various religious communities. [ 89 ] His school popularized Internal Alchemy Taoism and the usage of the term. [ 88 ]\n",
      "One of his \"seven perfected\" disciples, Qiu Chuji (1148–1227), founded the Dragon Gate lineage. Chuji was also made the leader of all religions in China by Genghis Khan , making his tradition the most powerful in all of China, and contributing to Longmen's lasting influence. [ 93 ] Another important Quanzhen lineage is the Qingjing pai, founded by the nun Sun Bu'er (1119–1182), the only female member of the \"seven perfected\". [ 93 ] Today, Quanzhen is mainly made up of celibate monastics who practice vegetarianism , sobriety , internal alchemy and recite daily liturgies. The largest lineage is Dragon Gate Taoism . [ 409 ]\n",
      "Much like Taoists who see writings made by influential members of their faith as having a divine nature, some Taoists view self-cultivation as a way for emotions and self to partake in divinity, [ 277 ] and a smaller subset of these [ citation needed ] view some mythological beings such as xian as being divine. [ 213 ] Xian were viewed in many lights and as completely different types of beings over different times and in different places. They were sometimes viewed as deities , parts of the celestial hierarchy, metaphorical ideals that people should strive to be like, reclusive Taoist masters who know how to control and harness spiritual energies or shamans. [ citation needed ]\n",
      "Hygiene Taoism is a Taoist tradition meant to increase life and \"physical and mental harmony\". [ 277 ] Some Taoists from the \"Hygiene School\" believed that they could survive only on their own breath and saliva to purify their bodies. [ 277 ]\n",
      "Much of Taoism in general is about cleanliness in some way and involves free thinking, [ 410 ] as well as rejecting the gratification of the senses, in order to purify oneself to make the mind like \"the sky\", \"sun\", and nature in general. [ 127 ]\n",
      "Karmic Taoism, or \"Action and Karma Taoism\", according to Wong, focuses on ethics and is grounded in the idea that the sacred celestial powers aid and reward those who do good and punish those who do evil. [ 411 ] This tradition can be traced back to Song dynasty Taoist Li Ying-chang and his Laozu Treatise on the Response of the Tao (T'ai-shang kan-ying p'ien). [ 411 ] Li sparked a popular movement which focused on the everyday life of ordinary persons instead of on temples, monasteries and sages. [ 411 ] At the core of this tradition is living in harmony with the Tao and with the Way of Heaven, which means acting with benevolence, kindness and compassion. [ 412 ] Doing evil is considered a transgression against the way and this evil will be punished by deities, celestial ministers and judges. [ 412 ]\n",
      "These ideas are quite ancient, the Taiping Jing (Scripture of Great Peace) states: \"accumulate good deeds, and prosperity will come to you from the Tao\". [ 412 ] Besides wealth and prosperity, Karmic Taoism also believes that doing good increases longevity, while doing evil decreases it. [ 413 ] Another common idea in this group of Taoist traditions is that there deities, like the Kitchen Lord, who monitor our actions and report to Heaven and the Jade Emperor (who tallies them and metes out punishment and reward). [ 414 ]\n",
      "Karmic Taoism is a nonsectarian tradition adopted by many Taoist sects. The Laozu Treatise on the Response of the Tao is studied in Quanzhen Taoism, Hsien-t'ien Tao and in the Wu-Liu sect. [ 415 ] All major schools of Taoism view ethics as the foundation for spirituality. [ 415 ] Furthermore, there are those who are not affiliated with a Taoist sect who may still follow Karmic Taoism in daily life. [ 415 ]\n",
      "Taoism has traditionally been divided into religious Taoism and philosophical Taoism (Dàojiào and Dàojiā), respectively.\n",
      "Some Taoist sects are expressly religious in the Western sense. [ citation needed ] \"Lord Heaven\" and \" Jade Emperor \" were terms for a Taoist supreme deity also used in Confucianism and Chinese folk religion , [ 416 ] and some conceptions of this deity thought of the two names as synonymous.\n",
      "The Taoist Jade Emperor in the first millennium AD was a primary deity among polytheists who had a heaven that contained numerous ministries and officials and which was \"modelled on...the earthly emperor ['s rule]\". [ 417 ]\n",
      "Polytheist Taoists venerated one or more of these kinds of spiritual entities: [ 418 ] [ 247 ] \"deified heroes...forces of nature\" [ 247 ] and \" nature spirits \", [ 418 ] xian , [ 247 ] spirits, [ 247 ] gods , [ 247 ] devas and other celestial beings from Chinese Buddhism , Indian Buddhism, and Chinese folk religion , [ 247 ] [ 419 ] [ 420 ] [ 421 ] [ 214 ] various kinds of beings occupying heaven , [ 247 ] members of the celestial bureaucracy , [ 247 ] ghosts , [ 88 ] \"mythical emperors\", [ 422 ] Laozi , [ 422 ] a trinity of high gods that varied in how it was thought of, [ 247 ] and the Three Pure Ones . [ 247 ] Some Taoists chose not to worship beings they saw as gods, [ 52 ] and only worshipped guardian spirits [ 53 ] or \"celestials\", [ 247 ] such as devas, various kinds of beings occupying heaven, members of the celestial bureaucracy, and xian . [ 247 ] In some Taoist sects, the Tao was the primary thing that was venerated and beings that would be gods in other sects were merely treated as supernatural beings similar to gods who could only act in accordance with the Tao's wishes. [ 422 ]\n",
      "When the Tao Te Ching was written, many Taoists told stories and legends about heroes \"whose bodies had been rendered invulnerable\". [ 423 ] This could be achieved by making contact with \"dragon's blood\" or a river in the afterlife, or drinking the \"waters of the 'Well of Life' and eating the 'fungus of immortality'\". [ 423 ]\n",
      "Ordinary Chinese in the early Tang dynasty often worshipped local gods, Buddhist gods and devas, and Taoist gods simultaneously, [ 214 ] and this population included a significant amount of the Taoists who have ever worshipped devas throughout history. [ further explanation needed ]\n",
      "The trinity is thought by scholars to have evolved into the Three Pure Ones. [ 247 ] It was thought of in the early Han dynasty as the three gods Tianyi, Diyi, and \"the Taiyi\". [ 247 ] These beings were varyingly interpreted as relatively simple heavenly, earthly, and all-purpose gods respectively, [ citation needed ] the \"supreme deity\" (an intangible god that represented the mind of the Tao), \"his disciple\", the Lord Tao (a more physical god representing the Tao), and Lord Lao (Laozi \"deified\"), [ 247 ] or an emanation of the Tao that was ultimately singular in nature.\n",
      "An unrelated trinity was the Three Great Emperor-Officials , three of the highest shen in some branches of religious Taoism thought to be able to pardon sins. [ 424 ]\n",
      "The Tao was not worshipped alone, [ 206 ] [ 425 ] although gods do exist that anthropomorphize it in various ways. Laozi was sometimes thought to be a god or \"the image of the Tao\". [ 206 ]\n",
      "\"Some Taoist adepts\" worshipped thousands of gods that were thought to exist in the body. [ 277 ]\n"

      "Advaita Vedanta ( / ʌ d ˈ v aɪ t ə v ɛ ˈ d ɑː n t ə / ; Sanskrit : अद्वैत वेदान्त , IAST : Advaita Vedānta ) is a Hindu tradition of textual exegesis and philosophy which states that jivatman , the individual experiencing self, is ultimately pure awareness mistakingly identified with body and the senses, [ 1 ] and non-different (\"na aparah\") from Ātman - Brahman , the highest Self or Reality . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ note 1 ] The term Advaita literally means \"non-secondness\", but is usually rendered as \" nondualism \", [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and often equated with monism . [ note 2 ] It rejects the Samkhya -dualism between Purusha , pure awareness or consciousness, and Prakriti ('nature', which includes matter but also cognition and emotion) as the two equal basic principles of existence. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Instead, it proposes that Atman-Brahman (awareness, purusha ) alone is ultimately real , and, though unchanging, [ 9 ] the cause and origin of the transient phenomenal world ( prakriti ). In this view, the jivatman or individual self is a mere reflection or limitation of singular Ātman in a multitude of apparent individual bodies. [ 10 ] It regards the material world as an ilusory appearance ( maya ) or \"an unreal manifestation ( vivarta ) of Brahman,\" [ 11 ] the latter as proposed by the 13th century scholar Prakasatman . [ 12 ]\n",
      "Advaita Vedanta is a Hindu sādhanā , a path of spiritual discipline and experience, [ note 3 ] and states that moksha (liberation from suffering and rebirth) [ 13 ] [ 14 ] is attained through knowledge of Brahman, recognizing the illusoriness of the phenomenal world and disidentification from the body-mind complex and the notion of 'doership', [ note 4 ] and acquiring vidyā (knowledge) [ 15 ] of one's true identity as Atman - Brahman , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] self-luminous ( svayam prakāśa ) [ note 5 ] awareness or Witness-consciousness . [ 20 ] [ note 6 ] Upanishadic statements such as tat tvam asi , \"that['s how] you are,\" destroy the ignorance ( avidyā ) regarding one's true identity by revealing that (jiv)Ātman is non-different from immortal [ note 7 ] Brahman . [ note 1 ]\n",
      "In a narrow sense Advaita Vedanta is the scholarly tradition belonging to the orthodox Hindu Vedānta [ note 8 ] tradition, with works written in Sanskrit; in a broader sense it refers to a medieval and modern syncretic tradition, upholding traditional Hindu values and culture, blending Vedānta with Yoga and other traditions and producing works in vernacular. [ 21 ] The earliest Advaita writings are the Sannyasa Upanishads (first centuries CE), the Vākyapadīya , written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century, [ 22 ] ) and the Māndūkya-kārikā written by Gauḍapāda (7th century). [ 23 ] Gaudapada adapted philosophical concepts from Buddhism , giving them a Vedantic basis and interpretation. [ 24 ] The Buddhist concepts were further Vedanticised by Adi Shankara (8th c. CE), who is generally regarded as the most prominent exponent of the Advaita Vedānta tradition, [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] though some of the most prominent Advaita-propositions come from other Advaitins, and his early influence has been questioned. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ note 9 ] Adi Shankara emphasized that, since Brahman is ever-present, Brahman-knowledge is immediate and requires no 'action' or 'doership', that is, striving (to attain) and effort. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Nevertheless, the Advaita tradition, as represented by Mandana Misra and others, also prescribes elaborate preparatory practice, including contemplation of the mahavakyas , [ 32 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ note 9 ] posing a paradox of two opposing approaches which is also recognized in other spiritual disciplines and traditions. [ 32 ] [ 37 ] [ note 10 ]\n",
      "Shankara's prominence as the exemplary defender of traditional Hindu-values and spirituality started to take shape only centuries later, in the 14th century, with the ascent of Sringeri matha and its jagadguru Vidyaranya (Madhava, 14th cent.) in the Vijayanagara Empire , [ note 11 ] While Adi Shankara did not embrace Yoga , [ 38 ] the Advaita-tradition by then had accepted yogic samadhi as a means to knowledge, explicitly incorporating elements from the yogic tradition and texts like the Yoga Vasistha and the Bhagavata Purana , [ 39 ] culminating in Swami Vivekananda 's full embrace and propagation of Yogic samadhi as an Advaita means of knowledge and liberation. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] In the 19th century, due to the influence of Vidyaranya 's Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha , [ 42 ] the importance of Advaita Vedānta was overemphasized by Western scholarship , [ 43 ] and Advaita Vedānta came to be regarded as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality, despite the numerical dominance of theistic Bhakti -oriented religiosity. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 43 ] [ note 9 ] In modern times, Advaita views appear in various Neo-Vedānta movements. [ 46 ]\n",
      "The word Advaita is a composite of two Sanskrit words:\n",
      "Advaita is often translated as \"non-duality,\" but a more apt translation is \"non-secondness.\" [ 2 ] Advaita has several meanings:\n",
      "The word Vedānta is a composition of two Sanskrit words: The word Veda refers to the whole corpus of vedic texts, and the word \"anta\" means 'end'. From this, one meaning of Vedānta is \"the end of the Vedas\" or \"the ultimate knowledge of the Vedas\". Veda can also mean \"knowledge\" in general, so Vedānta can be taken to mean \"the end, conclusion or finality of knowledge\". Vedānta is one of six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy .\n",
      "While \"a preferred terminology\" for Upanisadic philosophy \"in the early periods, before the time of Shankara\" was Puruṣavāda , [ 49 ] [ note 12 ] the Advaita Vedānta school has historically been referred to by various names, such as Advaita-vada (speaker of Advaita), Abheda-darshana (view of non-difference), Dvaita-vada-pratisedha (denial of dual distinctions), and Kevala-dvaita (non-dualism of the isolated). [ 50 ] It is also called māyāvāda by Vaishnava opponents, akin to Madhyamaka Buddhism , due to their insistence that phenomena ultimately lack an inherent essence or reality, [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ]\n",
      "According to Richard King, a professor of Buddhist and Asian studies, the term Advaita first occurs in a recognizably Vedantic context in the prose of Mandukya Upanishad . [ 50 ]\n",
      "According to Frits Staal , a professor of philosophy specializing in Sanskrit and Vedic studies, the word Advaita itself is from the Vedic era, and the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya (8th or 7th-century BCE [ 55 ] [ 56 ] ) is credited to be the one who coined it. [ 57 ] Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, translates the Advaita containing verse excerpt in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , as \"An ocean, a single seer without duality becomes he whose world is Brahman.\" [ note 14 ]\n",
      "While the term \"Advaita Vedanta\" in a strict sense may refer to the scholastic tradition of textual exegesis established by Shankara, \"advaita\" in a broader sense may refer to a broad current of advaitic thought, which incorporates advaitic elements with yogic thought and practice and other strands of Indian religiosity, such as Kashmir Shaivism and the Nath tradition. [ 59 ] The first connotation has also been called \"Classical Advaita\" [ 28 ] [ 60 ] and \"doctrinal Advaita,\" [ 61 ] and its presentation as such is due to mediaeval doxographies , [ 41 ] the influence of Orientalist Indologists like Paul Deussen , [ 62 ] and the Indian response to colonial influences, dubbed neo-Vedanta by Paul Hacker, who regarded it as a deviation from \"traditional\" Advaita Vedanta. [ 28 ] Yet, post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta incorporated yogic elements, such as the Yoga Vasistha , and influenced other Indian traditions, and neo-Vedanta is based on this broader strand of Indian thought. [ 28 ] This broader current of thought and practice has also been called \"greater Advaita Vedanta,\" [ 21 ] \"vernacular advaita,\" [ 28 ] and \"experiential Advaita.\" [ 61 ] It is this broader advaitic tradition which is commonly presented as \"Advaita Vedanta,\" though the term \"advaitic\" may be more apt. [ 28 ] [ note 15 ]\n",
      "The nondualism of Advaita Vedānta is often regarded as an idealist monism . [ note 2 ] According to King, Advaita Vedānta developed \"to its ultimate extreme\" the monistic ideas already present in the Upanishads. [ note 16 ] In contrast, states Milne, it is misleading to call Advaita Vedānta \"monistic,\" since this confuses the \"negation of difference\" with \"conflation into one.\" [ 63 ] Advaita is a negative term (a-dvaita), states Milne, which denotes the \"negation of a difference,\" between subject and object, or between perceiver and perceived. [ 63 ]\n",
      "According to Deutsch, Advaita Vedānta teaches monistic oneness, however without the multiplicity premise of alternate monism theories. [ 64 ] According to Jacqueline Suthren Hirst, Adi Shankara positively emphasizes \"oneness\" premise in his Brahma-sutra Bhasya 2.1.20, attributing it to all the Upanishads. [ 65 ]\n",
      "Nicholson states Advaita Vedānta contains realistic strands of thought, both in its oldest origins and in Shankara's writings. [ 66 ]\n",
      "Vedānta is one of the six classical Hindu darśanas , the Indian traditions of religious philosophy and practice which accept the authority of the Vedas. The various schools of Vedanta aim to harmonise the diverging views presented in the Prasthantrayi , the Principal Upanishads, [ 67 ] [ 68 ] along with the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gitā , offering an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices which aim at the attainment of moksha , release or liberation from transmigratory existence. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ note 17 ]\n",
      "\"Samkhya is not one of the systems of Indian philosophy. Samkhya is the philosophy of India!\"\n",
      "Gopinath Kaviraj [ 72 ]\n",
      "The Brahma Sutras, the constituting text of the Vedanta-tradition, rejects the purusha - prakriti dualism of the samkhya-tradition, [ 8 ] and \"much of the Brahmasutra appears to have been written to refute the perspective of the Samkhya school.\" [ 8 ] Samkhya postulates two independent primal principles, purusha (primal consciousness) and prakriti (nature, which includes both matter and cognition and emotions). In samkhya, prakriti consists of three qualities ( Guṇas ), which are in balance, untill they come in contact with purusha and the equilibrium is disturbed. From this pradhana then evolves the material universe, distinct from purusha , thereby postulating purusha as the efficient cause of all existence, and prakriti as its material cause or origin. [ 73 ]\n",
      "While closely related to Samkhya , [ 74 ] [ 8 ] the Advaita Vedānta tradition rejects this dualism, instead stating that Reality cannot evolve from an inert, consciousness- and intelligence-less principle or essence. Brahman, which is intelligent and consciousness, [ 8 ] is the sole Reality, [ 75 ] [ 76 ] \"that from which the origination, subsistence, and dissolution of this universe proceed,\" [ 73 ] as stated in the second verse of the Brahman Sutras. In Samkhya, purusha is the efficient cause, and prakriti is the material cause: purusha causes prakriti to manifest as the natural world. Advaita, like all Vedanta schools, states that Brahman, consciousness, is both the efficient and the material cause, that from which the material universe evolves. [ 77 ] Yet, in the Brahmasutras Brahma is a dynamic force, while the Advaita-tradition regards Brahman as an \"essentially unchanging and static reality,\" [ 9 ] sinve Brahman changing into something else would mean that Brahman would not exist anymore, while a partial change would leave Brahman divided. [ 9 ]\n",
      "By accepting that Brahman is the sole, unchanging reality, various theoretical difficulties arise which are not answered by the Brahmasutras, which asserts that the Upanishadic views have to be accepted due to their scriptural authority, \"regardless of logical problems and philosophical inconsistencies.\" [ 9 ] Advaita and other Vedānta traditions face several problems, for which they offer different solutions. [ 78 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] According to Deutsch and Dalvi, \"The basic problem of Vedanta [is] the relation between the plural, complex, changing phenomenal world and the Brahman in which it substantially subsists.\" [ 7 ] According to Mayeda, following the post-Shankara [ 8 ] predicate sat-cit-ananda , three problems emerge. First, how did Brahman, which is sat ('existence'), without any distinction, become manifold material universe? Second, how did Brahman, which is cit ('consciousness'), create the material world? Third, if Brahman is ananda ('bliss'), why did the empirical world of sufferings arise? The Brahma Sutras do not answer these philosophical queries, and later Vedantins including Shankara had to resolve them. [ 78 ]\n",
      "To solve these questions, Shankara introduced the concept of \"Unevolved Name-and-Form,\" or primal matter corresponding to Prakriti , from which the world evolves, [ 79 ] coming close to Samkhya dualism. [ 80 ] Shankara's notion of \"Unevolved Name-and-Form\" was not adopted by the later Advaita tradition; instead, the later tradition turned avidya into a metaphysical principle, namely mulavidya or \"root ignorance,\" a metaphysical substance which is the \"primal material cause of the universe ( upadana ).\" [ 81 ] In this view, Brahman alone is real, and the phenomenal world is an appearance ( maya ) or \"an unreal manifestation ( vivarta ) of Brahman.\" [ 11 ] Prakasatmans (13th c.) defense of vivarta to explain the origin of the world, which declared phenomenal reality to be an illusion , [ 12 ] became the dominant explanation, with which the primacy of Atman/Brahman can be maintained. [ 75 ] [ 76 ]\n",
      "A main question in all schools of Vedanta is the relation between the individual self ( jiva ) and Atman / Brahman . [ 82 ] As Shankara and his followers regard Atman/Brahman to be the ultimate Real, jivanatman is \"ultimately [to be] of the nature of Atman/Brahman.\" [ 75 ] [ 4 ] This truth is established from a literal reading of selected parts [ 83 ] of the oldest Principal Upanishads and Brahma Sutras , and is also found in parts of the Bhagavad Gitā and numerous other Hindu texts, [ 2 ] and is regarded to be self-evident. [ 84 ] [ note 18 ] Great effort is made to show the correctness of this reading, and its compatibility with reason and experience, by criticizing other systems of thought. [ 84 ] Vidya , correct knowledge or understanding of the identity of jivan-ātman and Brahman , destroys or makes null avidya ('false knowledge'), and results in liberation . [ 86 ] [ note 19 ]\n",
      "According to Shankara, taking a subitist position, [ 87 ] moksha is attained at once when the mahavakyas , articulating the identity of Atman and Brahman , are understood. [ 88 ] [ 33 ] [ note 20 ]\n",
      "According to the contemporary Advaita tradition, knowledge of Atman-Brahman is obtained gradually, by svādhyāya , study of the self and of the Vedic texts, which consists of four stages of samanyasa : virāga ('renunciation'), sravana ('listening to the teachings of the sages'), manana ('reflection on the teachings') and nididhyāsana , introspection and profound and repeated meditation on the mahavakyas , selected Upanishadic statements such as tat tvam asi ('that art thou' or 'you are That') which are taken literal, and form the srutic evidence for the identity of jivanatman and Atman-Brahman. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ web 5 ] This meditation negates the misconceptions, false knowledge, and false ego-identity , rooted in maya , which obfuscate the ultimate truth of the oneness of Brahman, and one's true identity as Atman-Brahman. [ 83 ] This culminates in what Adi Shankara refers to as anubhava , immediate intuition, a direct awareness which is construction-free, and not construction-filled. It is not an awareness of Brahman, but instead an awareness that is Brahman. [ 91 ] Although the threefold practice is broadly accepted in the Advaita tradition, and affirmed by Mandana Misra , [ 92 ] it is at odds with Shankara, [ 93 ] who took a subitist position. [ 87 ]\n",
      "Classical Advaita Vedānta states that all reality and everything in the experienced world has its root in Brahman, which is unchanging intelligent Consciousness. [ 2 ] To Advaitins, there is no duality between a Creator and the created universe. [ 2 ] [ 94 ] All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness are somehow also this one fundamental reality Brahman. [ 2 ] Yet, the knowing self has various experiences of reality during the waking, dream and dreamless states, [ 95 ] and Advaita Vedānta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions. [ 96 ] Advaita explains this by postulating different levels of reality, [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 95 ] and by its theory of errors ( anirvacaniya khyati ). [ 100 ] [ 2 ]\n",
      "Shankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion: [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ]\n",
      "Absolute and relative reality are valid and true in their respective contexts, but only from their respective particular perspectives. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 106 ] John Grimes explains this Advaita doctrine of absolute and relative truth with the example of light and darkness. [ 96 ] From the sun's perspective, it neither rises nor sets, there is no darkness, and \"all is light\". From the perspective of a person on earth, sun does rise and set, there is both light and darkness, not \"all is light\", there are relative shades of light and darkness. Both are valid realities and truths, given their perspectives. Yet, they are contradictory. What is true from one point of view, states Grimes, is not from another. To Advaita Vedānta, this does not mean there are two truths and two realities, but it only means that the same one Reality and one Truth is explained or experienced from two different perspectives. [ 96 ] [ 107 ]\n",
      "As they developed these theories, Advaita Vedānta scholars were influenced by some ideas from the Nyaya , Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy. [ 108 ] [ 99 ] These theories have not enjoyed universal consensus among Advaitins, and various competing ontological interpretations have flowered within the Advaita tradition. [ 2 ] [ 109 ] [ note 21 ]\n",
      "Ātman ( IAST : ātman, Sanskrit : आत्मन्) is the \"real self\" [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] [ note 22 ] or \"essence\" [ web 6 ] [ note 23 ] of the individual. It is caitanya , Pure Consciousness, [ 114 ] a consciousness, states Sthaneshwar Timalsina, that is \"self-revealed, self-evident and self-aware ( svaprakashata ),\" [ 113 ] and, states Payne, \"in some way permanent, eternal, absolute or unchanging.\" [ note 23 ] It is self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual. [ 115 ] It is \"a stable subjectivity, or a unity of consciousness through all the specific states of individuated phenomenality.\" [ 116 ] Ātman, states Eliot Deutsch, is the \"pure, undifferentiated, supreme power of awareness\", it is more than thought, it is a state of being, that which is conscious and transcends subject-object divisions and momentariness. [ 117 ] According to Ram-Prasad, \"it\" is not an object, but \"the irreducible essence of being [as] subjectivity, rather than an objective self with the quality of consciousness.\" [ 118 ]\n",
      "According to Shankara, it is self-evident and \"a matter not requiring any proof\" that Atman, the 'I', is 'as different as light is from darkness' from non-Atman, the 'you' or 'that', the material world whose characteristics are mistakenly superimposed on Atman, resulting in notions as \"I am this\" and \"This is mine.\" [ 119 ] One's real self is not the constantly changing body, not the desires, not the emotions, not the ego, nor the dualistic mind, [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] but the introspective, inwardly self-conscious \"on-looker\" ( saksi ), [ 123 ] which is in reality completely disconnected from the non-Atman. [ 119 ]\n",
      "The jivatman or individual self is a mere reflection of singular Atman in a multitude of apparent individual bodies. [ 10 ] It is \"not an individual subject of consciousness,\" [ 116 ] but the same in each person and identical to the universal eternal Brahman , [ 124 ] a term used interchangeably with Atman. [ 125 ]\n",
      "Atman is often translated as soul , [ note 24 ] though the two concepts differ significantly, since \"soul\" includes mental activities, whereas \"Atman\" solely refers to detached witness-consciousness.\n",
      "Advaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (suṣupti), which are empirically experienced by human beings, [ 126 ] [ 127 ] and correspond to the Three Bodies Doctrine : [ 128 ]\n",
      "Advaita also posits \"the fourth,\" Turiya , which some describe as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. [ web 7 ] [ web 8 ] Turiya is the state of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite ( ananta ) and non-different ( advaita/abheda ), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada , non-origination, is apprehended. [ 130 ] According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all pervading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, [ note 5 ] real, immanent in all things and transcendent. [ 131 ] Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the Jivanmukta . [ 132 ] [ 133 ] [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ]\n",
      "Advaita traces the foundation of this ontological theory in more ancient Sanskrit texts. [ 137 ] For example, chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of Chandogya Upanishad discuss the \"four states of consciousness\" as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] One of the earliest mentions of Turiya , in the Hindu scriptures, occurs in verse 5.14.3 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . [ note 25 ] The idea is also discussed in other early Upanishads. [ 139 ]\n",

      "In the Advaita tradition, consciousness is svayam prakāśa, \"self-luminous,\" [ 2 ] [ 140 ] [ note 5 ] which means that \"self is pure awareness by nature.\" [ 141 ] According to Dasgupta, it is \"the most fundamental concept of the Vedanta.\" [ 142 ] According to T. R. V. Murti , the Vedanta concept is explained as follows:\n",
      "The point to be reached is a foundational consciousness that is unconditional, self-evident, and immediate ( svayam-prakāśa ). It is that to which everything is presented, but is itself no presentation, that which knows all, but is itself no object. The self should not be confused with the contents and states which it enjoys and manipulates. If we have to give an account of it, we can describe it only as what it is not, for any positive description of it would be possible only if it could be made an object of observation, which from the nature of the case it is not. We \"know\" it only as we withdraw ourselves from the body with which we happen to be identified, in this transition. [ 143 ] [ note 26 ]\n",
      "According to Jonardon Ganeri, the concept was introduced by the Buddhist philosopher Dignāga (c.480–c.540 CE), and accepted by the Vedanta tradition; [ 141 ] according to Zhihua Yao, the concept has older roots in the Mahasanghika school. [ 144 ]\n",
      "According to Advaita Vedānta, Brahman is the true Self, consciousness, awareness, intelligent, possesed with will, and the only Reality ( Sat ). [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ note 27 ] Brahman is Paramarthika Satyam , \"Absolute Truth\" [ 148 ] or absolute Real. [ 149 ] It is That which is unborn and unchanging, [ 146 ] [ 150 ] and immortal. [ note 7 ] Other than Brahman , everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya . Brahman is \"not sublatable\", [ 145 ] which means it cannot be superseded by a still higher reality: [ 151 ]\n",
      "the true Self, pure consciousness [...] the only Reality ( sat ), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the one thing that is not sublatable\". [ 145 ]\n",
      "In Advaita, Brahman is the substrate and cause of all changes. [ 146 ] [ 150 ] Refuting samkhya, which considers pradhana or prakriti the material cause (primal matter) and purusha the efficient cause, [ 152 ] in Advaita Vedanta Brahman is considered to be the material cause [ note 28 ] and the efficient cause [ note 29 ] of all that exists. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ] The Brahma Sutras I.1.2 state that Brahman is:\n",
      "...that from which the origination, subsistence, and dissolution of this universe proceed. [ 156 ] [ note 30 ]\n",
      "Advaita's Upanishadic roots state Brahman's qualities [ note 31 ] to be Sat-cit-ānanda , [ 158 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ] \"true being-consciousness-bliss,\" [ 160 ] [ 161 ] or \"Eternal Bliss Consciousness\". [ 162 ] [ note 32 ] A distinction is made between nirguna Brahman , formless Brahman, and saguna Brahman , Brahman with form, that is, Ishvara , God. Nirguna Brahman is undescribable, and the Upanishadic neti neti ('not this, not that' or 'neither this, nor that') negates all conceptualizations of Brahman. [ 90 ] [ 163 ]\n",
      "Avidyā is a central tenet of Shankara's Advaita, and became the main target of Ramanuja's criticism of Shankara. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] In Shankara's view, avidyā is adhyasa , \"the superimposition of the qualities of one thing upon another.\" [ 166 ] As Shankara explains in the Adhyasa-bhasya , the introduction to the Brahmasutrabhasya :\n",
      "Owing to an absence of discrimination, there continues a natural human behaviour in the form of 'I am this' or 'This is mine'; this is avidya. It is a superimposition of the attributes of one thing on another. The ascertainment of the nature of the real entity by separating the superimposed thing from it is vidya (knowledge, illumination).\n",
      "Due to avidya , we're steeped in loka drsti , the empirical view. [ 167 ] From the beginning we only perceive the empirical world of multiplicity, taking it to be the only and true reality. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] Due to avidyā there is ignorance, or nescience, of the real Self, Atman-Brahman , mistakenly identifying the Self with the body-mind complex. [ web 11 ] With parmartha drsti ignorance is removed and vidya is acquired, and the Real, distinctionless Brahman is perceived as the True reality. [ 167 ]\n",
      "The notion of avidyā and its relationship to Brahman creates a crucial philosophical issue within Advaita Vedānta thought: how can avidyā appear in Brahman, since Brahman is pure consciousness? [ 169 ] For Shankara, avidya is a perceptual or psychological error. [ 81 ] According to Satchidanandendra Saraswati, for Shankara \" avidya is only a technical name to denote the natural tendency of the human mind that is engaged in the act of superimposition.\" [ 170 ] The later tradition diverged from Shankara by turning avidya into a metaphysical principle, namely mulavidya or \"root ignorance,\" a metaphysical substance which is the \"primal material cause of the universe ( upadana ),\" thereby setting aside Shankara's 'Unevolved Name-and-Form' as the explanation for the existence of materiality. [ 81 ] [ 171 ] According to Mayeda, \"[i]n order to save monism, they characterized avidya as indefinable as real or unreal ( sadasadbhyam anirvacanya ), belonging neither to the category of being nor to that of non-being.\" [ 81 ] In the 20th century, this theory of mulavidya became a point of strong contention among Advaita Vedantins, with Satchidanandendra Saraswati arguing that Padmapada and Prakasatman had misconstrued Shanakara's stance. [ 172 ]\n",
      "Shankara did not give a 'location' of avidya , giving precedence to the removal of ignorance. [ 173 ] [ note 33 ] Sengaku Mayeda writes, in his commentary and translation of Adi Shankara 's Upadesasahasri:\n",
      "Certainly the most crucial problem which Sankara left for his followers is that of avidyā. If the concept is logically analysed, it would lead the Vedanta philosophy toward dualism or nihilism and uproot its fundamental position. [ 174 ]\n",
      "The later Advaita-tradition diverged from Shankara, trying to determinate a locus of avidya , [ 175 ] with the Bhamati-school locating avidya in the jiva c.q. prakriti , while the Vivarana-school locates it in Brahman. [ 176 ] [ 175 ]\n",
      "In Advaita Vedanta, the perceived empirical world, \"including people and other existence,\" is Māyā, \"appearance.\" [ 177 ] [ 178 ] Jiva, conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, and misunderstands and interprets the physical, changing world as the sole and final reality. [ 177 ] Due to avidya , we take the phenomenal world to be the final reality, [ web 11 ] while in Reality only Sat ( True Reality, Brahman) is Real and unchanging. [ 179 ]\n",
      "While Shankara took a realistic stance, and his explanations are \"remote from any connotation of illusion,\" the 13th century scholar Prakasatman , founder of the influential Vivarana school, introduced the notion that the world is illusory. [ 12 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] According to Hacker, maya is not a prominent theme for Shankara, in contrast to the later Advaita tradition, and \"the word maya has for [Shankara] hardly any terminological weight.\" [ 180 ]\n",
      "Due to avidya, atman is covered by koshas (sheaths or bodies), which hide man's true nature. According to the Taittiriya Upanishad , the Atman is covered by five koshas, usually rendered \"sheath\". [ 181 ] They are often visualized like the layers of an onion. [ 182 ] From gross to fine the five sheaths are:\n",
      "Cause and effect are an important topic in all schools of Vedanta . [ note 34 ] Two sorts of causes are recognised, namely Nimitta kāraṇa , the efficient cause , that which causes the existence of the universe, and Upādāna kāraṇa , the material cause , that from which the matery of this universe comes. [ 184 ] All schools of Vedānta agree that Brahman is both the material and the efficient cause, and all subscribe to the theory of Satkāryavāda , [ web 13 ] which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. [ 11 ] [ note 35 ]\n",
      "There are different views on the origination of the empirical world from Brahman. All commentators \"agree that Brahman is the cause of the world,\" but disagree on how exactly Brahman is the cause of the world. [ 11 ] According to Nicholson, \"Mediaeval Vedantins distinguished two basic positions.\" Parinamavada is the idea that the world is a real transformation ( parinama ) of Brahman. [ 11 ] Vivartavada is the idea that\n",
      "the world is merely an unreal manifestation ( vivarta ) of Brahman. Vivartavada states that although Brahman appears to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are unreal manifestation, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts. [ 11 ]\n",

      "The Brahma Sutras , the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedānta, [ 11 ] [ web 13 ] as well as Samkhya argue for parinamavada . [ web 13 ] The \"most visible advocates of Vivartavada,\" states Nicholson, are the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara. [ 11 ] \"Although the world can be described as conventionally real\", adds Nicholson, \"the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman's effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated\". [ web 13 ] [ note 36 ]\n",
      "Yet, Adi Shankara himself most likely explained causality through parinamavada . [ web 13 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 186 ] In Shankara's works \" Brahman constitutes the basic essence ( svabhava ) of the universe (BS Bh 3.2.21) and as such the universe cannot be thought of as distinct from it (BS Bh 2.1.14).\" In Shankara's view, then, \"The world is real, but only in so far as its existence is seen as totally dependent upon Brahman .\" [ 186 ]\n",
      "Shankara introduced the concept of \"Unevolved Name-and-Form,\" or primal matter corresponding to Prakriti , from which the world evolves, [ 79 ] but this concept was not adopted by the later Advaita tradition. [ 12 ] Vivartavada became the dominant explanation, with which the primacy of Atman/Brahman can be maintained. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker already noted that Adi Shankara did not advocate Vivartavada , and his explanations are \"remote from any connotation of illusion\".

      "2. I am Brahman (pure consciousness). It is pure consciousness that appears as this universe.\n",
      "It was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman, who founded the influential Vivarana school, who gave a definition to vivarta , introducing the notion that the world is illusory. It is Prakasatman's theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara's position. [ 12 ] Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the vivarta-vada isn't Shankara's theory, that Shankara's ideas appear closer to parinama-vada , and the vivarta explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later. [ web 13 ] [ note 38 ]\n",
      "The soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge as being in essence (Atman), awareness or witness-consciousness , and complete understanding of the identity of jivan-ātman and Brahman . [ 16 ] Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is the attainment of Brahman , immortality, [ 189 ] and leads to moksha (liberation) from suffering [ note 39 ] and samsara , the cycle of rebirth [ 16 ] This is stated by Shankara as follows:\n",
      "I am other than name, form and action. My nature is ever free! I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman. I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.\n",
      "According to Advaita Vedānta, liberation can be achieved while living, and is called Jivanmukti . [ 190 ] [ 191 ] [ note 40 ] in contrast to Videhamukti (moksha from samsara after death) in theistic sub-schools of Vedānta. [ 192 ] [ better source needed ] The Atman-knowledge, that is the knowledge of true Self and its relationship to Brahman is central to this liberation in Advaita thought. [ note 41 ] Atman-knowledge, to Advaitins, is that state of full awareness, liberation and freedom which overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others and all beings, the non-dual Oneness, that Brahman is in everything, and everything is Brahman. [ 115 ] [ 124 ] [ note 42 ]\n",
      "According to Anantanand Rambachan , in Advaita, this state of liberating self-knowledge includes and leads to the understanding that \"the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.\" [ 193 ]\n",
      "Advaita Vedānta regards the liberated state of being Atman-Brahman as one's true identity and inherent to being human. According to Shankara and the Vivarana-school, no human action can 'produce' this liberated state, as it is what one already is. [ 32 ] As Swami Vivekananda stated:\n",
      "The Vedas cannot show you Brahman, you are That already. They can only help to take away the veil that hides truth from our eyes. The cessation of ignorance can only come when I know that God and I are one; in other words, identify yourself with Atman, not with human limitations. The idea that we are bound is only an illusion [Maya]. Freedom is inseparable from the nature of the Atman. This is ever pure, ever perfect, ever unchangeable.\n",
      "Yet, the Advaita-tradition also emphasizes human effort, the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to realize one's true identity as Atman-Brahman and attain moksha . [ 32 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] According to critics of neo-Advaita , which also emphasizes direct insight, traditional Advaita Vedanta entails more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature, but also includes self-restraint, textual studies and ethical perfection. It is described in classical Advaita books like Shankara's Upadesasahasri [ 195 ] and the Vivekachudamani , which is also attributed to Shankara.\n",
      "Sruti (scriptures), proper reasoning and meditation are the main sources of knowledge ( vidya ) for the Advaita Vedānta tradition. [ 36 ] [ 196 ] [ 197 ] It teaches that correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is achievable by svādhyāya , [ 198 ] study of the self and of the Vedic texts, and three stages of practice: sravana (perception, hearing), manana (thinking) and nididhyasana (meditation), [ 36 ] a three-step methodology that is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . [ 199 ] [ 200 ]\n",
      "The Advaita student has to develop the fourfold qualities, [ 201 ] or behavioral qualifications ( Samanyasa , Sampattis , sādhana-catustaya ): [ 202 ] [ 203 ] [ 204 ] [ note 43 ] A student in Advaita Vedānta tradition is required to develop these four qualities:\n",
      "The Advaita tradition teaches that correct knowledge, which destroys avidya , psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman, [ 18 ] is obtained in jnanayoga through three stages of practice, [ 203 ] sravana (hearing), manana (thinking) and nididhyasana (meditation). [ 36 ] This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad : [ 199 ] [ 200 ]\n",
      "Although the threefold practice is broadly accepted in the Advaita tradition, Shankara's works show an ambivalence toward it: while accepting its authenticity and merits, as it is based in the scriptures, he also takes a subitist position, [ 87 ] arguing that moksha is attained at once when the mahavakyas , articulating the identity of Atman and Brahman , are understood. [ 88 ] [ 33 ] [ note 45 ] According to Rambachan, \"it is not possible to reconcile Sankara's views with this seemingly well-ordered system.\" [ 93 ]\n",
      "Mandana Misra , on the other hand, explicitly affirms the threefold practice as the means to acquire knowledge of Brahman, referring to meditation as dhyana . [ 212 ] He states that these practices, though conceptual, 'can eliminate both ignorance and coneptuality at the same time, leaving only the \"pure, transparent nature\" of self-awareness'. [ 213 ]\n",
      "Bilimoria states that these three stages of Advaita practice can be viewed as sadhana practice that unifies Yoga and Karma (\"action,\" referring here to ritual) ideas, and was most likely derived from these older traditions. [ 214 ] [ 209 ]\n",
      "Advaita Vedānta school has traditionally had a high reverence for a Guru (teacher), and recommends that a competent Guru be sought in one's pursuit of spirituality, though this is not mandatory. [ 215 ] Reading of Vedic literature and reflection is the most essential practice. [ 215 ] Adi Shankara, states Comans, regularly employed compound words \"such as Sastracaryopadesa (instruction by way of the scriptures and the teacher) and Vedāntacaryopadesa (instruction by way of the Upanishads and the teacher) to emphasize the importance of Guru\". [ 215 ] According to Comans, this reflects the Advaita tradition which holds a competent teacher as important and essential to gaining correct knowledge, freeing oneself from false knowledge, and to self-realization. [ 216 ] Nevertheless, in the Bhamati-school the guru has a less essential role, as he can explain the teachings, but the student has to venture its further study. [ 217 ]\n",
      "A guru is someone more than a teacher, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the guru serving as a \"counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student. [ 218 ] The guru, states Joel Mlecko, is more than someone who teaches specific type of knowledge, and includes in its scope someone who is also a \"counselor, a sort of parent of mind and soul, who helps mold values and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life.\" [ 218 ]\n",
      "In classical Indian thought, pramana ( means of knowledge ) concerns questions like how correct knowledge can be acquired; how one knows, how one doesn't; and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired. [ 219 ] [ 220 ] In contrast to other schools of Indian philosophy, early Vedanta paid little attention to pramana . [ 221 ] The Brahmasutras are not concerned with pramana , and pratyaksa (sense-perception) and anumana (inference) refer there to sruti and smriti respectively. [ 221 ] Shankara recognized the means of knowledge, [ 222 ] [ note 46 ] but his thematic focus was upon metaphysics and soteriology , and he took for granted the pramanas . [ 227 ] For Shankara, sabda is the only means of knowledge for attaining Brahman-jnana . [ 228 ] According to Sengaku Mayeda, \"in no place in his works [...] does he give any systematic account of them,\" [ 227 ] taking Atman-Brahman to be self-evident ( svapramanaka ) and self-established ( svatahsiddha ), and \"an investigation of the means of knowledge is of no use for the attainment of final release.\" [ 227 ]\n",
      "Nevertheless, the Advaita tradition accepts altogether six kinds of pramāṇas . [ 229 ] [ 230 ] [ 231 ] [ 228 ] While Adi Shankara emphasized Śabda (शब्द), relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts with regard to religious insights, [ 220 ] [ 232 ] [ 229 ] [ 233 ] and also accepted pratyakṣa (प्रत्यक्षाय), perception; and anumāṇa (अनुमान), inference — Classical Advaita Vedānta, just like the Bhatta Purvamimamsaka school , also accepts upamāṇa (उपमान), comparison, analogy; arthāpatti (अर्थापत्ति), postulation, derivation from circumstances; [ 220 ] [ 234 ] and anupalabdhi (अनुपलब्धि), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof. [ 232 ] [ 229 ]\n",
      "The Advaita tradition emphasizes that, since Brahman is ever-present, Brahman-knowledge is immediate and requires no 'action', that is, striving and effort, as articulated by Shankara; [ 31 ] yet, it also prescribes elaborate preparatory practice, including yogic samadhi, posing a paradox which is also recognized in other spiritual disciplines and traditions. [ 235 ] [ 37 ] [ note 10 ]\n",
      "Shankara regarded the srutis as the means of knowledge of Brahman, and he was ambivalent about yogic practices and meditation, which at best may prepare one for Brahma-jnana . [ web 18 ] According to Rambachan, criticising Vivekananda, Shankara states that the knowledge of Brahman can only be obtained from inquiry of the Shruti , and not by Yoga or samadhi, which at best can only silence the mind. [ 236 ] The Bhamati school and the Vivarana school differed on the role of contemplation, but they both \"deny the possibility of perceiving supersensuous knowledge through popular yoga techniques.\" [ 237 ] Later Advaita texts like the Dṛg-Dṛśya-Viveka (14th century) and Vedāntasara (of Sadananda) (15th century) added samādhi as a means to liberation, a theme that was also emphasized by Swami Vivekananda. [ 39 ] The Vivekachudamani , traditionally attributed to Shankara but post-dating him, [ 238 ] \"conceives of nirvikalpa samadhi as the premier method of Self-realization over and above the well-known vedantic discipline of listening, reflection and deep contemplation.\" [ 59 ] Koller states that yogic concentration is an aid to gaining knowledge in Advaita. [ 84 ]\n",
      "The role of anubhava , anubhuti (\"experience,\" \"intuition\" [ 239 ] ) as \"experience\" in gaining Brahman-jnana is contested. While neo-Vedanta claims a central position for anubhava as \"experience,\" Shankara himself regarded reliance on textual authority as sufficient for gaining Brahman-jnana , [ 240 ] [ note 47 ] \"the intuition of Brahman,\" [ 239 ] and used anubhava interchangeably with pratipatta , \"understanding\". [ 241 ] Arvind Sharma argues that Shankara's own \"direct experience of the ultimate truth\" guided him in selecting \"those passages of the scriptures that resonate with this experience and will select them as the key with which to open previously closed, even forbidden, doors.\" [ 242 ] [ note 48 ]\n",
      "The Vivekachudamani \"explicit[ly] declar[es] that experience ( anubhuti ) is a pramana , or means of knowing (VCM 59),\" [ 59 ] and neo-Vedanta also accepts anubhava (\"personal experience\") as a means of knowledge. [ 243 ] Dalal and others state that anubhava does not center around some sort of \"mystical experience,\" but around the correct knowledge of Brahman. [ 197 ] [ 244 ] Nikhalananda concurs, stating that (knowledge of) Atman and Brahman can only be reached by buddhi , \"reason,\" [ 245 ] stating that mysticism is a kind of intuitive knowledge, while buddhi is the highest means of attaining knowledge. [ 246 ]\n",
      "Since Gaudapada, [ 247 ] who adopted the Buddhist four-cornered negation which negates any positive predicates of 'the Absolute', [ 248 ] [ 249 ] [ note 49 ] a central method in Advaita Vedanta to express the inexpressable is the method called Adhyaropa Apavada . [ 247 ] In this method, which was highly estimated by Satchidanandendra Saraswati , a property is imposed ( adhyaropa ) on Atman to convince one of its existence, whereafter the imposition is removed ( apavada ) to reveal the true nature of Atman as nondual and undefinable. [ 251 ] In this method, \"That which cannot be expressed is expressed through false attribution and subsequent denial.\" [ 252 ] As Shankara writes, \"First let me bring them on the right path, and then I will gradually be able to bring them round to the final truth afterwards.\" [ 252 ] For example, Atman, the real \"I,\" is described as witness , giving \"it\"  an attribute to separate it from non-self. Since this implies a duality between observer and observed, next the notion of \"witness\" is dropped, by showing that the Self cannot be seen and is beyond qualifications, and only that what is remains, without using any words: [ web 19 ]\n",
      "After one separates oneself i.e. 'I' or Atman from the sense objects, the qualities superimposed on Self are also negated by saying that which not being and not non-being, cannot be described by words, without beginning and end (BG 13.32) or as in Satyam Jnanam Anantam Brahman, beyond words, beyond mind and speech, etc. Here there is an attempt to negate the earlier attribute like being witness, bliss, most subtlest, etc. After this negation of false superimposition, Self Alone shines. One enters into the state of Nirvikalp Samadhi, where there is no second, no one to experience and hence this state cannot be described in words. [ web 19 ]\n",
      "Moksha , liberation from suffering and rebirth and attaining immortality, is attained by disidentification from the body-mind complex and gaining self-knowledge as being in essence Atman , and attaining knowledge of the identity of Atman and Brahman . [ 16 ] [ 189 ] According to Shankara, the individual Ātman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical. [ 253 ] The real self is Sat , \"the Existent,\" that is, Atman-Brahman . [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ note 1 ] Whereas the difference between Atman and non-Atman is deemed self-evident, knowledge of the identity of Atman and Brahman is revealed by the shruti , especially the Upanishadic statement tat tvam asi .\n",
      "According to Shankara, a large number of Upanishadic statements reveal the identity of Atman and Brahman . In the Advaita Vedanta tradition, four of those statements, the Mahavakyas , which are taken literal, in contrast to other statements, have a special importance in revealing this identity. [ 83 ] [ 256 ] They are:\n",
      "The longest chapter of Shankara's Upadesasahasri , chapter 18, \"That Art Thou,\" is devoted to considerations on the insight \"I am ever-free, the existent\" ( sat ), and the identity expressed in Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7 in the mahavakya (great sentence) \" tat tvam asi \", \"that thou art.\" [ 268 ] [ 269 ] In this statement, according to Shankara, tat refers to ' Sat , [ 269 ] \"the Existent\" [ 260 ] [ 7 ] [ 270 ] [ 271 ] Existence, Being, [ web 21 ] or Brahman, [ 272 ] the Real, the \"Root of the world,\" [ 269 ] [ note 52 ] the true essence or root or origin of everything that exists. [ 7 ] [ 270 ] [ web 21 ] \"Tvam\" refers to one's real I, pratyagatman or inner Self, [ 273 ] the \"direct Witness within everything,\" [ 20 ] \"free from caste, family, and purifying ceremonies,\" [ 274 ] the essence, Atman , which the individual at the core is. [ 275 ] [ 276 ] As Shankara states in the Upadesasahasri :\n",
      "Up.I.174: \"Through such sentences as \"Thou art That\" one knows one's own Atman , the Witness of all the internal organs.\" Up.I.18.190: \"Through such sentences as \"[Thou art] the Existent\" [...] right knowledge concerning the inner Atman will become clearer.\" Up.I.18.193-194: \"In the sentence \"Thou art That\" [...] [t]he word \"That\" means inner Atman .\" [ 277 ]\n",
      "The statement \"tat tvam asi\" sheds the false notion that Atman is different from Brahman . [ 278 ] According toNakamura, the non-duality of atman and Brahman \"is a famous characteristic of Sankara's thought, but it was already taught by Sundarapandya\" [ 279 ] (c.600 CE or earlier). [ 280 ] Shankara cites Sundarapandya in his comments to Brahma Sutra verse I.1.4:\n",
      "When the metaphorical or false atman is non-existent, [the ideas of my] child, [my] body are sublated. Therefore, when it is realized that 'I am the existent Brahman, atman' , how can anyduty exist? [ 281 ]\n",
      "From this, and a large number of other accordances, Nakamura concludes that Shankar was not an original thinker, but \"a synthesizer of existing Advaita and the rejuvenator, as well as a defender, of ancient learning.\" [ 282 ]\n",
      "In the Upadesasahasri Shankara , Shankara is ambivalent on the need for meditation on the Upanishadic mahavakya . He states that \"right knowledge arises at the moment of hearing,\" [ 33 ] and rejects prasamcaksa or prasamkhyana meditation, that is, meditation on the meaning of the sentences, and in Up.II.3 recommends parisamkhyana , [ 283 ] separating Atman from everything that is not Atman , that is, the sense-objects and sense-organs, and the pleasant and unpleasant things and merit and demerit connected with them. [ 284 ] Yet, Shankara then concludes with declaring that only Atman exists, stating that \"all the sentences of the Upanishads concerning non-duality of Atman should be fully contemplated, should be contemplated.\" [ 285 ] As Mayeda states, \"how they [ prasamcaksa or prasamkhyana versus parisamkhyana ] differ from each other in not known.\" [ 286 ]\n",
      "Prasamkhyana was advocated by Mandana Misra, [ 287 ] the older contemporary of Shankara who was the most influential Advaitin until the 10th century. [ 30 ] [ 288 ] [ note 9 ] \"According to Mandana, the mahavakyas are incapable, by themselves, of bringing about brahmajnana . The Vedanta-vakyas convey an indirect knowledge which is made direct only by deep meditation ( prasamkhyana ). The latter is a continuous contemplation of the purport of the mahavakyas . [ 289 ] Vācaspati Miśra, a student of Mandana Misra, agreed with Mandana Misra, and their stance is defended by the Bhamati-school, founded by Vācaspati Miśra. [ 290 ] In contrast, the Vivarana school founded by Prakasatman (c. 1200–1300) [ 291 ] follows Shankara closely, arguing that the mahavakyas are the direct cause of gaining knowledge. [ 292 ]\n",
      "Shankara's insistence on direct knowledge as liberating also differs from the asparsa yoga described in Gaudapada's Mandukyakarika III.39-46. [ 293 ] In this practice of 'non-contact' ( a- sparśa ), the mind is controlled and brought to rest, and does not create \"things\" (appearances) after which it grasps; it becomes non-dual, free from the subject-[grasping]-object dualism. [ 294 ] [ 48 ] Knowing that only Atman-Brahman is real, the creations of the mind are seen as false appearances (MK III.31-33). When the mind is brought to rest, it becomes or is Brahman (MK III.46). [ 293 ]\n",
      "In the Upadesasahasri Shankara discourages ritual worship such as oblations to Deva (God), because that assumes the Self within is different from Brahman . [ note 53 ] [ note 54 ] The \"doctrine of difference\" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, \"he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman\". [ 299 ] [ 300 ] The false notion that Atman is different from Brahman [ 278 ] is connected with the novice's conviction that ( Upadesasaharsi II.1.25 )\n",
      "...I am one [and] He is another; I am ignorant, experience pleasure and pain, am bound and a transmigrator [whereas] he is essentially different from me, the god not subject to transmigration. By worshipping Him with oblation, offerings, homage and the like through the [performance of] the actions prescribed for [my] class and stage of life, I wish to get out of the ocean of transmigratory existence. How am I he? [ 301 ]\n",
      "Recognizing oneself as \"the Existent- Brahman ,\" which is mediated by scriptural teachings, is contrasted with the notion of \"I act,\" which is mediated by relying on sense-perception and the like. [ 302 ] According to Shankara, the statement \"Thou art That\" \"remove[s] the delusion of a hearer,\" [ 303 ] \"so through sentences as \"Thou art That\" one knows one's own Atman , the witness of all internal organs,\" [ 304 ] and not from any actions. [ 305 ] [ note 55 ] With this realization, the performance of rituals is prohibited, \"since [the use of] rituals and their requisites is contradictory to the realization of the identity [of Atman ] with the highest Atman .\" [ 307 ]\n",
      "Some claim, states Deutsch, \"that Advaita turns its back on all theoretical and practical considerations of morality and, if not unethical, is at least 'a-ethical' in character\". [ 308 ] However, Deutsch adds, ethics does have a firm place in this philosophy. Its ideology is permeated with ethics and value questions enter into every metaphysical and epistemological analysis, and it considers \"an independent, separate treatment of ethics are unnecessary\". [ 308 ] [ 309 ] According to Advaita Vedānta, states Deutsch, there cannot be \"any absolute moral laws, principles or duties\", instead in its axiological view Atman is \"beyond good and evil\", and all values result from self-knowledge of the reality of \"distinctionless Oneness\" of one's real self, every other being and all manifestations of Brahman. [ 310 ] Advaitin ethics includes lack of craving, lack of dual distinctions between one's own Self and another being's, good and just Karma . [ 311 ]\n",
      "The values and ethics in Advaita Vedānta emanate from what it views as inherent in the state of liberating self-knowledge. This state, according to Rambachan, includes and leads to the understanding that \"the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.\" [ 193 ] Such knowledge and understanding of the indivisibility of one's and other's Atman, Advaitins believe leads to \"a deeper identity and affinity with all\". It does not alienate or separate an Advaitin from his or her community, rather awakens \"the truth of life's unity and interrelatedness\". [ 193 ] These ideas are exemplified in the Isha Upanishad – a sruti for Advaita, as follows:\n",
      "One who sees all beings in the self alone, and the self of all beings, feels no hatred by virtue of that understanding. For the seer of oneness, who knows all beings to be the self, where is delusion and sorrow?\n",
      "Adi Shankara, in verse 1.25 to 1.26 of his Upadeśasāhasrī , asserts that the Self-knowledge is understood and realized when one's mind is purified by the observation of Yamas (ethical precepts) such as Ahimsa (non-violence, abstinence from injuring others in body, mind and thoughts), Satya (truth, abstinence from falsehood), Asteya (abstinence from theft), Aparigraha (abstinence from possessiveness and craving) and a simple life of meditation and reflection. [ 313 ] Rituals and rites can help focus and prepare the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge, [ 314 ] but can be abandoned when moving on to \"hearing, reflection, and meditation on the Upanishads.\" [ 315 ]\n",
      "Elsewhere, in verses 1.26–1.28, the Advaita text Upadesasahasri states the ethical premise of equality of all beings. Any Bheda (discrimination), states Shankara, based on class or caste or parentage is a mark of inner error and lack of liberating knowledge. [ 316 ] This text states that the fully liberated person understands and practices the ethics of non-difference. [ 316 ]\n",
      "One, who is eager to realize this highest truth spoken of in the Sruti, should rise above the fivefold form of desire: for a son, for wealth, for this world and the next, and are the outcome of a false reference to the Self of Varna (castes, colors, classes) and orders of life. These references are contradictory to right knowledge, and reasons are given by the Srutis regarding the prohibition of the acceptance of difference. For when the knowledge that the one non-dual Atman (Self) is beyond phenomenal existence is generated by the scriptures and reasoning, there cannot exist a knowledge side by side that is contradictory or contrary to it.\n",
      "The Upanishads , the Bhagavad Gitā and Brahma Sutras are the central texts of the Advaita Vedānta tradition, lending authority to the doctrines about the identity of Atman and Brahman and their changeless nature. [ 318 ] [ 319 ]\n",
      "Adi Shankara gave a nondualist interpretation of these texts in his commentaries. Adi Shankara 's Bhashya (commentaries) have become central texts in the Advaita Vedānta philosophy, but are one among many ancient and medieval manuscripts available or accepted in this tradition. [ 27 ] The subsequent Advaita tradition has further elaborated on these sruti and commentaries. Adi Shankara is also credited for the famous text Nirvana Shatakam .\n",
      "The Vedānta tradition provides exegeses of the Upanishads , the Brahma Sutras , and the Bhagavadgita , collectively called the Prasthanatrayi , literally, three sources . [ 320 ] [ 318 ] [ 319 ]\n",
      "The Advaita Vedānta tradition considers the knowledge claims in the Vedas to be the crucial part of the Vedas, not its karma-kanda (ritual injunctions). [ 318 ] The knowledge claims about self being identical to the nature of Atman-Brahman are found in the Upanishads , which Advaita Vedānta has regarded as \"errorless revealed truth.\" [ 318 ] Nevertheless, states Koller, Advaita Vedantins did not entirely rely on revelation, but critically examined their teachings using reason and experience, and this led them to investigate and critique competing theories. [ 318 ]\n",
      "Advaita Vedānta, like all orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, accepts as an epistemic premise that Śruti (Vedic literature) is a reliable source of knowledge. [ 70 ] [ 323 ] [ 324 ] The Śruti includes the four Vedas including its four layers of embedded texts – the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early Upanishads. [ 331 ] Of these, the Upanishads are the most referred to texts in the Advaita school.\n",
      "The possibility of different interpretations of the Vedic literature, states Arvind Sharma, was recognized by ancient Indian scholars. [ 332 ] [ 330 ] The Brahmasutra (also called Vedānta Sutra, composed in 1st millennium BCE) accepted this in verse 1.1.4 and asserts the need for the Upanishadic teachings to be understood not in piecemeal cherrypicked basis, rather in a unified way wherein the ideas in the Vedic texts are harmonized with other means of knowledge such as perception, inference and remaining pramanas . [ 332 ] [ 329 ] This theme has been central to the Advaita school, making the Brahmasutra as a common reference and a consolidated textual authority for Advaita. [ 332 ] [ 333 ]\n",
      "The Bhagavad Gitā, similarly in parts can be interpreted to be a monist Advaita text, and in other parts as theistic Dvaita text. It too has been widely studied by Advaita scholars, including a commentary by Adi Shankara. [ 243 ] [ 330 ]\n",
      "A large number of texts are attributed to Shankara; of these texts, the Brahma Sutra Bhasya (commentary on the Brahma Sutras), the commentaries on the principal Upanishads, and the Upadesasahasri are considered genuine and stand out.\n",
      "Post-Shankara Advaita saw the composition of both scholarly commentaries and treatises, as well as, from late medieaval times (14th century) on, popular works and compositions which incorporate Yoga ideas. These include notable texts mistakenly attributed to Shankara, such as the Vivekachudamani , Atma bodha , and Aparokshanubhuti; and other texts like Advaita Bodha Deepika and Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka . Texts which influenced the Advaita tradition include the Avadhuta Gita , the Yoga Vasistha , and the Yoga Yajnavalkya .\n",
      "Advaita Vedānta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of renunciation . Philosophy and renunciation are closely related: [ web 23 ]\n",
      "Most of the notable authors in the advaita tradition were members of the sannyasa tradition, and both sides of the tradition share the same values, attitudes and metaphysics. [ web 23 ]\n",
      "According to tradition, around 740 AD Gaudapada founded Shri Gaudapadacharya Math [ note 59 ] , also known as Kavaḷē maṭha . It is located in Kavale , Ponda , Goa, [ web 24 ] and is the oldest matha of the South Indian Saraswat Brahmins . [ 334 ] [ web 25 ]\n",
      "Shankara, himself considered to be an incarnation of Shiva , [ web 23 ] is credited with establishing the Dashanami Sampradaya, organizing a section of the Ekadandi monks under an umbrella grouping of ten names. [ web 23 ] Several Hindu monastic and Ekadandi traditions, however, remained outside the organisation of the Dasanāmis. [ 335 ] [ 336 ] [ 337 ]\n",
      "Sankara is said to have organised the Hindu monks of these ten sects or names under four Maṭhas (Sanskrit: मठ ) (monasteries), called the Amnaya Mathas , with the headquarters at Dvārakā in the West, Jagannatha Puri in the East, Sringeri in the South and Badrikashrama in the North. [ web 23 ] According to tradition, each math was first headed by one of his four main disciples, and the tradition continues since then. Yet, according to Paul Hacker, no mention of the mathas can be found before the 14th century CE. [ 338 ] Until the 15th century, the timespan of the directors of Sringeri Math are unrealistically long, spanning 60+ and even 105 years. After 1386, the timespans become much shorter. [ 339 ] According to Hacker, these mathas may have originated as late as the 14th century, to propagate Shankara's view of Advaita. [ 340 ] [ note 60 ] [ note 61 ] According to another tradition in Kerala, after Sankara's samadhi at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four mathas in Thrissur, namely Naduvil Madhom , Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom.\n",
      "Monks of these ten orders differ in part in their beliefs and practices, and a section of them is not considered to be restricted to specific changes attributed to Shankara. While the dasanāmis associated with the Sankara maths follow the procedures attributed to Adi Śankara, some of these orders remained partly or fully independent in their belief and practices; and outside the official control of the Sankara maths. The advaita sampradaya is not a Saiva sect, [ web 23 ] [ 344 ] despite the historical links with Shaivism. [ note 62 ] Nevertheless, contemporary Sankaracaryas have more influence among Saiva communities than among Vaisnava communities. [ web 23 ]\n",
      "The Smarta tradition of Hinduism is a synthesis of various strands of Indian religious thought and practice, which developed with the Hindu synthesis , dating back to the early first century CE. [ note 63 ] It is particularly found in south and west India, and revers all Hindu divinities as a step in their spiritual pursuit. [ 346 ] [ 347 ] [ 348 ] Their worship practice is called Panchayatana puja . [ 349 ] [ 346 ] The worship symbolically consists of five deities: Shiva , Vishnu , Devi or Durga , Surya and an Ishta Devata or any personal god of devotee's preference. [ 347 ] [ 350 ]\n",
      "In the Smarta tradition, Advaita Vedānta ideas combined with bhakti are its foundation. Adi Shankara is regarded as the greatest teacher [ 348 ] and reformer of the Smarta. [ 351 ] According to Alf Hiltebeitel , Shankara's Advaita Vedānta and practices became the doctrinal unifier of previously conflicting practices with the smarta tradition. [ note 64 ]\n",
      "Philosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images and statues ( murti ), or just five marks or any anicons on the ground, are visibly convenient icons of spirituality saguna Brahman . [ 353 ] [ 349 ] The multiple icons are seen as multiple representations of the same idea, rather than as distinct beings. These serve as a step and means to realizing the abstract Ultimate Reality called nirguna Brahman. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (Self) and Brahman – as \"That art Thou\". [ 353 ] [ 354 ]\n",
      "Advaita Vedānta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines and dialectical techniques with Buddhism. [ 355 ] [ 356 ] According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhism scholar O. Rozenberg, \"a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw.\" [ 355 ] Murti notices that \"the ultimate goal\" of Vedanta, Samkhya and Mahayana Buddhism is \"remarkably similar\"; while Advaita Vedanta postulates a \"foundational self,\" \"Mahayana Buddhism implicitly affirms the existence of a deep underlying reality behind all empirical manifestations in its conception of sunyata (the indeterminate, the void), or vijnapti-matrata (consciousness only), or tathata (thatness), or dharmata (noumenal reality).\" [ 143 ] According to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism. [ 357 ]\n",
      "The influence of Mahayana Buddhism on Advaita Vedānta has been significant. [ 357 ] [ 358 ] Sharma points out that the early commentators on the Brahma Sutras were all realists , or pantheist realists. He states that they were influenced by Buddhism, particularly during the 5th-6th centuries CE when Buddhist thought developing in the Yogacara school. [ 359 ]\n",
      "Von Glasenap states that there was a mutual influence between Vedanta and Buddhism. [ note 65 ] Dasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedānta represent \"different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara.\" [ 360 ] [ note 66 ]\n",
      "The influence of Buddhist doctrines on Gauḍapāda has been a vexed question. [ 363 ] [ 364 ] Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gauḍapāda was influenced by Buddhism, at least in terms of using Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gauḍapāda was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist. [ 363 ]\n",
      "Adi Shankara, states Natalia Isaeva, incorporated \"into his own system a Buddhist notion of maya which had not been minutely elaborated in the Upanishads\". [ 355 ] According to Mudgal, Shankara's Advaita and the Buddhist Madhyamaka view of ultimate reality are compatible because they are both transcendental, indescribable, non-dual and only arrived at through a via negativa ( neti neti ). Mudgal concludes therefore that \"the difference between Sunyavada (Mahayana) philosophy of Buddhism and Advaita philosophy of Hinduism may be a matter of emphasis, not of kind. [ 365 ] Similarly, there are many points of contact between Buddhism's Vijnanavada and Shankara's Advaita. [ 366 ] According to S.N. Dasgupta,\n",
      "Shankara and his followers borrowed much of their dialectic form of criticism from the Buddhists. His Brahman was very much like the sunya of Nagarjuna [...] The debts of Shankara to the self-luminosity [ note 5 ] of the Vijnanavada Buddhism can hardly be overestimated. There seems to be much truth in the accusations against Shankara by Vijnana Bhiksu and others that he was a hidden Buddhist himself. I am led to think that Shankara's philosophy is largely a compound of Vijnanavada and Sunyavada Buddhism with the Upanisad notion of the permanence of self superadded. [ 367 ]\n",
      "The Advaita Vedānta tradition has historically rejected accusations of crypto-Buddhism highlighting their respective views on Atman , Anatta and Brahman . [ 368 ] Yet, some Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's Tathāgatagarbha sūtras suggest self-like concepts, variously called Tathāgatagarbha or Buddha nature . [ 369 ] [ 370 ] In modern era studies, scholars such as Wayman and Wayman state that these \"self-like\" concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. [ 371 ] [ 372 ] Some scholars posit that the Tathāgatagarbha Sutras were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists. [ 373 ] [ 374 ] [ 375 ]\n",
      "The epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Vedānta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge – perception and inference, while Advaita Vedānta accepts six (described elsewhere in this article). [ 229 ] [ 376 ] [ 377 ] However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's Śabda pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method. [ 378 ]\n",
      "Advaita Vedānta posits a substance ontology , an ontology which holds that underlying the change and impermanence of empirical reality is an unchanging and permanent absolute reality, like an eternal substance it calls Atman-Brahman. [ 379 ] In its substance ontology, as like other philosophies, there exist a universal, particulars and specific properties and it is the interaction of particulars that create events and processes. [ 380 ] In contrast, Buddhism posits a process ontology , also called as \"event ontology\". [ 381 ] [ 380 ] According to the Buddhist thought, particularly after the rise of ancient Mahayana Buddhism scholarship, there is neither empirical nor absolute permanent reality and ontology can be explained as a process. [ 381 ] [ 382 ] [ note 67 ] There is a system of relations and interdependent phenomena ( pratitya samutpada ) in Buddhist ontology, but no stable persistent identities, no eternal universals nor particulars. Thought and memories are mental constructions and fluid processes without a real observer, personal agency or cognizer in Buddhism. In contrast, in Advaita Vedānta, like other schools of Hinduism, the concept of self (atman) is the real on-looker, personal agent and cognizer. [ 384 ]\n",
      "Some Hindu scholars criticized Advaita for its Maya and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism. [ 385 ] [ 357 ] sometimes referring to the Advaita-tradition as Māyāvāda . [ 386 ]\n",
      "Ramanuja , the founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedānta , accused Adi Shankara of being a Prachanna Bauddha , that is, a \"crypto-Buddhist\", [ 387 ] and someone who was undermining theistic Bhakti devotionalism. [ 357 ] The non-Advaita scholar Bhaskara of the Bhedabheda Vedānta tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as \"this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists\", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy. [ 357 ]\n",
      "The Advaita Vedānta ideas, particularly of 8th century Adi Shankara, were challenged by theistic Vedānta philosophies that emerged centuries later, such as the 11th-century Vishishtadvaita (qualified nondualism ) of Ramanuja , and the 14th-century Dvaita (theistic dualism) of Madhvacharya . [ 388 ] Their application of Vedanta philosophy to ground their faith turned Vedanta into a major factor in India's religious landscape. [ 389 ]\n",
      "Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita school and Shankara 's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedānta schools, [ 390 ] [ 391 ] both are premised on the assumption that all Selfs can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya and his Dvaita subschool of Vedānta believed that some Selfs are eternally doomed and damned. [ 392 ] [ 393 ] Shankara's theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world ( Maya ) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence. [ 394 ] [ 395 ] Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one's unchanging Atman (Self) as the same as Atman in everyone else as well as being identical to the nirguna Brahman. [ 391 ] [ 396 ] [ 397 ] In contrast, Ramanuja's theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and saguna Brahman with attributes is also real. [ 395 ] God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and all of the world of matter is the glory of God's body. [ 390 ] The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god ( saguna Brahman, Vishnu), one which ultimately leads one to the oneness with nirguna Brahman. [ 390 ] [ 394 ] [ 395 ]\n",
      "Vallabhacharya (1479–1531 CE), the proponent of the philosophy of Shuddhadvaita Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world. [ 398 ] That is why shuddhadvaita is known as 'Unmodified transformation' or 'Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda'. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual Selfs and the world. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a 'part' (but devoid of bliss). [ 399 ]\n",
      "Madhvacharya was also a critic of Advaita Vedānta. Advaita's nondualism asserted that Atman (Self) and Brahman are identical (both in bondage and liberation [ 400 ] ), there is interconnected oneness of all Selfs and Brahman, and there are no pluralities. [ 401 ] [ 402 ] Madhva in contrast asserted that Atman (Self) and Brahman are different (both in bondage and liberation [ 400 ] ), only Vishnu is the Lord (Brahman), individual Selfs are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities. [ 401 ] [ 402 ] Madhvacharya stated that both Advaita Vedānta and Mahayana Buddhism were a nihilistic school of thought.

[ note 68 ] Advaita Vedānta influenced Krishna Vaishnavism in the different parts of India. [ 404 ] One of its most popular text, the Bhagavata Purana , adopts and integrates in Advaita Vedānta philosophy.

[ 23 ] Later scholarship added the Sannyasa Upanishads (first centuries CE [ 436 ] ) to the earliest known corpus, some of which are of a sectarian nature, [ 437 ] and have a strong Advaita Vedānta outlook.

      "According to tradition, Gauḍapāda (6th century) [ 441 ] was the teacher of Govinda Bhagavatpada and the grandteacher of Shankara. Gauḍapāda wrote or compiled [ 442 ] the Māṇḍukya Kārikā , also known as the Gauḍapāda Kārikā or the Āgama Śāstra . [ 443 ] The Māṇḍukya Kārikā is a commentary in verse form on the Māṇḍūkya Upanishad , one of the shortest Upanishads consisting of just 13 prose sentences. Of the ancient literature related to Advaita Vedānta, the oldest surviving complete text is the Māṇḍukya Kārikā . [ 444 ] The Māṇḍūkya Upanishad was considered to be a Śruti before the era of Adi Shankara, but not treated as particularly important. [ 443 ] In later post-Shankara period its value became far more important, and regarded as expressing the essence of the Upanishad philosophy. The entire Karika became a key text for the Advaita school in this later era. [ 445 ] [ note 73 ]\n",
      "Gaudapada took over the Yogachara teaching of vijñapti-mātra , \"representation-only,\" which states that the empirical reality that we experience is a fabrication of the mind, experienced by consciousness-an-sich, [ 248 ] [ note 74 ] and the four-cornered negation, which negates any positive predicates of 'the Absolute'. [ 248 ] [ 249 ] [ note 75 ] Gaudapada \"wove [both doctrines] into the philosophy of Mandukaya Upanisad , which was further developed by Shankara\". [ 448 ] [ note 76 ] In this view,\n",

      "Maṇḍana Miśra , an older contemporary of Shankara, [ 451 ] was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of Kumarila , but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the Brahma-siddhi . [ 452 ] [ 453 ] According to Fiordalis, he was influenced by the Yoga-tradition, and with that indirectly by Buddhism, given the strong influence of Buddhism on the Yoga-tradition. [ 38 ] For a couple of centuries he seems to have been regarded as \"the most important representative of the Advaita position,\" [ 30 ] [ 288 ] [ note 77 ] and the \"theory of error\" set forth in the Brahma-siddhi became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error.

      "Shankara was a scholar who synthesized and systematized Advaita-vāda thought which already existed at his lifetime. [ 455 ] According to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of the early Vedantins and Shankara's thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara's thought \"were advocated by someone before Śankara\". [ 455 ] According to Nakamura, after the growing influence of Buddhism on Vedānta, culminating in the works of Gauḍapāda, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works, [ 456 ] synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita. [ 457 ] According to Koller, using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita Vedānta in the 8th century, reforming Badarayana 's Vedānta tradition.

[ 30 ] [ 288 ] Only when Vacaspati Misra, an influential student of Maṇḍana Miśra, harmonised the teachings of Shankara with those of Maṇḍana Miśra, Shankara's teachings gained prominence. [ 466 ] Some modern Advaitins argue that most of post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta actually deviates from Shankara, and that only his student Suresvara, who's had little influence, represents Shankara correctly. [ 467 ] In this view, Shankara's influential student Padmapada misunderstood Shankara, while his views were manitained by the Suresvara school. [ 467 ] According to Satchidanandendra Sarasvati , \"almost all the later Advaitins were influenced by Mandana Misra and Bhaskara .\" [ 468 ] [ note 9 ] Until the 11th century, Vedanta itself was a peripheral school of thought; [ 469 ] Vedanta became a major influence when Vedanta philosophy was utilized by various sects of Hinduism to ground their doctrines, [ 389 ] such as Ramanuja (11th c.), who aligned bhakti , \"the major force in the religions of Hinduism,\" with philosophical thought, meanwhile rejecting Shankara's views.

[ 472 ] Vidyaranya , also known as Madhava, who was the Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham from ca. 1374–1380 to 1386 [ 472 ] played a central role in this growing influence of Advaita Vedanta, and the deification of Shankara as a ruler - renunciate .

[ 472 ] [ note 78 ] Vidyaranya and the Sringeri matha competed for royal patronage and converts with Srivaisnava Visistadvaita , which was dominant in territories conquered by the Vijayanagara Empire, [ 476 ] and Madhava (the pre-ordination name of Vidyaranya) presented Shankara's teachings as the summit of all darsanas , portraying the other darsanas as partial truths which converged in Shankara's teachings. [ 340 ] The subsequent Shankara Digvijayam genre, following the example of the earlier Madhva Digvijayam , [ 477 ] presented Shankara as a ruler - renunciate , conquering the four quarters of India and bringing harmony. [ 473 ] [ 474 ] The genre created legends to turn Shankara into a \"divine folk-hero who spread his teaching through his digvijaya (\"universal conquest\") all over India like a victorious conqueror.\" [ 340 ] [ 475 ]\n",
      "Shankara's position was further established in the 19th and 20th century, when neo-Vedantins and western Orientalists, following Vidyaranya, elevated Advaita Vedanta \"as the connecting theological thread that united Hinduism into a single religious tradition.\" [ 478 ] Shankara became \"an iconic representation of Hindu religion and culture,\" despite the fact that most Hindus do not adhere to Advaita Vedanta. [ 479 ]\n",
      "Two defunct schools are the Pancapadika and Istasiddhi , which were replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school. [ 291 ] The still existing Bhāmatī and Vivarana developed in the 11th-14th century. [ web 31 ] [ 217 ] These schools worked out the logical implications of various Advaita doctrines. Two of the problems they encountered were the further interpretations of the concepts of māyā and avidya . [ web 31 ]\n",
      "Padmapada (c. 800 CE), [ 480 ] the founder of the defunct Pancapadika school, was a direct disciple of Shankara. He wrote the Pancapadika , a commentary on the Sankara-bhaya . [ 480 ] Padmapada diverged from Shankara in his description of avidya , designating prakrti as avidya or ajnana . [ 481 ]\n",
      "Sureśvara (fl. 800–900 CE) [ 482 ] was a contemporary of Shankara, [ 451 ] and often (incorrectly) identified with Maṇḍana Miśra. [ 451 ] [ note 79 ] Sureśvara has also been credited as the founder of a pre-Shankara branch of Advaita Vedānta. [ 482 ]\n",
      "Mandana Mishra's student Vachaspati Miśra (9th/10th century CE), [ 483 ] [ 484 ] [ 485 ] who is believed to have been an incarnation of Shankara to popularize the Advaita view, [ 486 ] wrote the Bhamati , a commentary on Shankara's Brahma Sutra Bhashya , and the Brahmatattva-samiksa , a commentary on Mandana Mishra's Brahma-siddhi . His thought was mainly inspired by Mandana Miśra, and harmonises Shankara's thought with that of Mandana Miśra. [ 487 ] [ web 31 ] The Bhamati school takes an ontological approach. It sees the Jiva as the source of avidya. [ web 31 ] It sees contemplation as the main factor in the acquirement of liberation, while the study of the Vedas and reflection are additional factors. [ 488 ] [ 489 ]\n",
      "Vimuktatman (c. 1200 CE) [ 490 ] wrote the Ista-siddhi . [ 490 ] It is one of the four traditional siddhi , together with Mandana's Brahma-siddhi , Suresvara's Naiskarmya-siddhi , and Madusudana's Advaita-siddhi . [ 491 ] According to Vimuktatman, absolute Reality is \"pure intuitive consciousness\". [ 492 ] His school of thought was eventually replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school. [ 291 ]\n",
      "Prakasatman (c. 1200–1300) [ 291 ] wrote the Pancapadika-Vivarana , a commentary on the Pancapadika by Padmapadacharya . [ 291 ] The Vivarana lends its name to the subsequent school. According to Roodurmun, \"[H]is line of thought [...] became the leitmotif of all subsequent developments in the evolution of the Advaita tradition.\" [ 291 ] The Vivarana school takes an epistemological approach. It is distinguished from the Bhamati school by its rejection of action and favouring Vedic study and \"a direct apprehension of Brahma.\" [ 488 ] Prakasatman was the first to propound the theory of mulavidya or maya as being of \"positive beginningless nature\", [ 493 ] and sees Brahman as the source of avidya. Critics object that Brahman is pure consciousness, so it cannot be the source of avidya. Another problem is that contradictory qualities, namely knowledge and ignorance, are attributed to Brahman. [ web 31 ]\n",
      "Another late figure which is widely associated with Advaita and was influential on late Advaita thought was Śrīharṣa .\n",
      "Michael S. Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studied, but \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedānta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\" [ 426 ]\n",
      "While indologists like Paul Hacker and Wilhelm Halbfass took Shankara's system as the measure for an \"orthodox\" Advaita Vedānta, the living Advaita Vedānta tradition in medieval times was influenced by, and incorporated elements from, the yogic tradition and texts like the Yoga Vasistha and the Bhagavata Purana . [ 39 ] Yoga and samkhya had become minor schools of thought since the time of Shankara, and no longer posed a thread for the sectarian identity of Advaita, in contrast to the Vaishnava traditions. [ 471 ]\n",
      "The Yoga Vasistha became an authoritative source text in the Advaita vedānta tradition in the 14th century, and the \"yogic Advaita\" [ 494 ] [ 495 ] of Vidyāraņya's Jivanmuktiviveka (14th century) was influenced by the (Laghu-)Yoga-Vasistha , which in turn was influenced by Kashmir Shaivism . [ 496 ] Vivekananda's 19th century emphasis on nirvikalpa samadhi was preceded by medieval yogic influences on Advaita Vedānta. In the 16th and 17th centuries, some Nath and hatha yoga texts also came within the scope of the developing Advaita Vedānta tradition. [ 59 ]\n",
      "According to Andrew Nicholson , it was with the arrival of Islamic rule, first in the form of Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire , and the subsequent persecution of Indian religions, that Hindu scholars began a self-conscious attempts to define an identity and unity . [ 497 ] [ 498 ] Between the twelfth and the fourteenth century, this effort emerged with the \"astika and nastika\" schema of classifying Indian philosophy. [ 497 ]\n",
      "It is only during this period that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta was established. [ 29 ] [ 470 ] [ 471 ] Advaita Vedanta's position as most influential Hindu darsana took shape as Advaitins in the Vijayanagara Empire competed for patronage from the royal court, and tried to convert others to their sect. [ 476 ] Sringeri matha started to receive patronage from the kings of the Vijayanagara Empire [ 288 ] [ 29 ] [ 472 ] [ 470 ] who shifted their allegiance from Advaitic Agamic Shaivism to Brahmanical Advaita orthodoxy. [ 499 ]\n",
      "Central in this repositioning was Vidyāraṇya , [ 29 ] [ 470 ] also known as Madhava, who was the Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham from 1380 to 1386 [ 500 ] and a minister in the Vijayanagara Empire. [ 501 ] He inspired the re-creation of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire of South India, in response to the devastation caused by the Islamic Delhi Sultanate , [ 29 ] [ 470 ] [ 471 ] [ 501 ] but his efforts were also targeted at Srivaisnava groups, especially Visistadvaita , which was dominant in territories conquered by the Vijayanagara Empire. [ 502 ] Sects competed for patronage from the royal court, and tried to convert others to their own sectarian system, and Vidyaranya efforts were aimed at promoting Advaita Vedanta. [ 476 ] Most of Shankara's biographies were created and published from the 14th to the 17th century, such as the widely cited Śankara-vijaya , in which legends were created to turn Shankara into a \"divine folk-hero who spread his teaching through his digvijaya (\"universal conquest\") all over India like a victorious conqueror.\" [ 340 ] [ 475 ] [ 503 ]\n",
      "Vidyaranya and his brothers wrote extensive Advaitic commentaries on the Vedas and Dharma to make \"the authoritative literature of the Aryan religion\" more accessible. [ 340 ] In his doxography Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha (\"Summary of all views\") Vidyaranya presented Shankara's teachings as the summit of all darsanas , presenting the other darsanas as partial truths which converged in Shankara's teachings, which was regarded to be the most inclusive system. [ 504 ] [ 340 ] The Vaishanava traditions of Dvaita and Visitadvaita were not classified as Vedanta, and placed just above Buddhism and Jainism, reflecting the threat they posed for Vidyaranya's Advaita allegiance. [ 42 ] Bhedabheda wasn't mentioned at all, \"literally written out of the history of Indian philosophy.\" [ 505 ] Vidyaranya became head of Sringeri matha , proclaiming that it was established by Shankara himself. [ 340 ] [ 475 ] Vidyaranya enjoyed royal support, [ 501 ] and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol of values, spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara's Vedānta philosophies, and establish monasteries ( mathas ) to expand the cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedānta. [ 29 ]\n",
      "Michael S. Allen has written on the influence and popularity of Advaita Vedanta in early modern north India, especially on the work of the Advaita Dādū-panthī monk Niścaldās (ca. 1791–1863), author of The Ocean of Inquiry (Hindi: Vichāra-sāgara), a vernacular compendium of Advaita. [ 21 ] According to Allen, the work of Niścaldās \"was quite popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: it was translated into over eight languages and was once referred to by Vivekananda as having 'more influence in India than any [book] that has been written in any language within the last three centuries.'\" [ 21 ]\n",
      "Allen highlights the widespread prominence in early modern India of what he calls \"Greater Advaita Vedānta\" which refers to popular Advaita works, including \"narratives and dramas, “eclectic” works blending Vedānta with other traditions, and vernacular works such as The Ocean of Inquiry .\" [ 21 ] Allen refers to several popular late figures and texts which draw on Advaita Vedanta, such as the Maharashtrian sant Eknāth (16th c.), the popular Adhyātma-rāmāyaṇa (ca. late 15th c.), which synthesizes Rama bhakti and advaita metaphysics and the Tripurā-rahasya (a tantric text that adopts an advaita metaphysics). [ 21 ] Other important vernacular Advaita figures include the Hindu authors Manohardās and Māṇakdās (who wrote the  Ātma-bodh). Advaita literature was also written in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, and Oriya. [ 21 ]\n",
      "According to King, with the consolidation of the British imperialist rule the new rulers started to view Indians through the \"colonially crafted lenses\" of Orientalism . In response Hindu nationalism emerged, striving for socio-political independence and countering the influence of Christian missionaries. [ 508 ] Among the colonial era intelligentsia the monistic Advaita Vedānta has been a major ideological force for Hindu nationalism, [ 509 ] with Hindu intellectuals formulating a \"humanistic, inclusivist\" response, now called Neo-Vedānta, attempting to respond to this colonial stereotyping of \"Indian culture [as] backward, superstitious and inferior to the West.\" [ 510 ]\n",
      "Due to the influence of Vidyaranya's Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha , early Indologists regarded Advaita Vedanta as the most accurate interpretation of the Upanishads. [ 42 ] Vedānta came to be regarded, both by westerners as by Indian nationalists, as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedānta came to be regarded as \"then paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion\" and umbrella of \"inclusivism\". [ 511 ] Colonial era Indian thinkers, such as Vivekananda , presented Advaita Vedānta as an inclusive universal religion, a spirituality that in part helped organize a religiously infused identity. It also aided the rise of Hindu nationalism as a counter weight to Islam-infused Muslim communitarian organizations such as the Muslim League , to Christianity-infused colonial orientalism and to religious persecution of those belonging to Indian religions. [ 512 ] [ 498 ] [ 513 ] Neo-Vedānta subsumed and incorporated Buddhist ideas thereby making the Buddha a part of the Vedānta tradition, all in an attempt to reposition the history of Indian culture. [ 424 ] This view on Advaita Vedānta, according to King, \"provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression\". [ 514 ]\n",
      "Vivekananda discerned a universal religion , regarding all the apparent differences between various traditions as various manifestations of one truth. [ 515 ] Vivekananda emphasised nirvikalpa samadhi as the spiritual goal of Vedānta, he equated it to the liberation in Yoga and encouraged Yoga practice which he called Raja yoga . [ 516 ] [ note 80 ] With the efforts of Vivekananda , modern formulations of Advaita Vedānta have \"become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought\", though Hindu beliefs and practices are diverse. [ 425 ]\n",
      "Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , first a professor at Oxford University and later a President of India, further popularized Advaita Vedānta, presenting it as the essence of Hinduism. [ web 32 ] According to Michael Hawley, Radhakrishnan saw other religions, as well as \"what Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism,\" as interpretations of Advaita Vedānta, thereby \"in a sense Hindusizing all religions\". [ web 32 ] Radhakrishnan metaphysics was grounded in Advaita Vedānta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedānta for contemporary needs and context. [ web 32 ] [ note 81 ]\n",
      "Mahatma Gandhi declared his allegiance to Advaita Vedānta, and was another popularizing force for its ideas. [ 519 ]\n",
      "Contemporary teachers are the orthodox Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham ; the more traditional teachers Sivananda Saraswati (1887–1963), Chinmayananda Saraswati (1916-1993), [ web 33 ] Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya) (1930-2015), Swami Paramarthananda, Swami Tattvavidananda Sarasvati, Carol Whitfield (Radha), Sri Vasudevacharya (previously Michael Comans) [ web 33 ] and less traditional teachers such as Narayana Guru .

[ web 34 ]\n",
      "Advaita Vedānta has gained attention in western spirituality and New Age as nondualism , where various traditions are seen as driven by the same non-dual experience. [ 520 ] Nonduality points to \"a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object\".

      "Ubuntu ( Zulu pronunciation: [ùɓúntʼù] ) [ 1 ] (meaning humanity in some Bantu languages , such as Zulu ) describes a set of closely related Bantu African-origin value systems that emphasize the interconnectedness of individuals with their surrounding societal and physical worlds.  \"Ubuntu\" is sometimes translated as \"I am because we are\" (also \"I am because you are\"), [ 2 ] or \"humanity towards others\" ( Zulu umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu ). In Xhosa , the latter term is used, but is often meant in a more philosophical sense to mean \"the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity\". [ 3 ]\n",
      "Although the most popular term referring to the philosophy today is \"ubuntu\" ( Zulu language , South Africa), the philosophy is believed to stretch back to the beginning of proto-Bantu language and has many other names in other Bantu languages .\n",
      "It is also found in other Bantu countries not mentioned here. [ 4 ] [ 5 ]\n",
      "There are various definitions of the word \"Ubuntu\". The most recent definition was provided by the African Journal of Social Work ( AJSW ). The journal defined Ubuntu as:\n",
      "A collection of values and practices that people of Africa or of African origin view as making people authentic human beings. While the nuances of these values and practices vary across different ethnic groups, they all point to one thing – an authentic individual human being is part of a larger and more significant relational, communal, societal, environmental and spiritual world [ 4 ]\n",
      "There are many different (and not always compatible) definitions of what Ubuntu is. [ 7 ] Even with the various definitions, Ubuntu encompasses the interdependence of humans on another and the acknowledgment of one's responsibility to their fellow humans and the world around them. It is a philosophy that supports collectivism over individualism .\n",
      "Ubuntu asserts that society gives human beings their humanity. An example is a Zulu -speaking person who when commanding to speak in Zulu would say \" khuluma isintu \", which means \"speak the language of people\". When someone behaves according to custom, a Sotho -speaking person would say \" ke motho \", which means \"he/she is a human\". The aspect of this that would be exemplified by a tale told (often, in private quarters) in Nguni \" kushone abantu ababili ne Shangaan \", in Sepedi \" go tlhokofetje batho ba babedi le leShangane \", in English (two people died and one Shangaan ). In each of these examples, humanity comes from conforming to or being part of the tribe.\n",
      "According to Michael Onyebuchi Eze, the core of Ubuntu can best be summarised as follows:\n",
      "A person is a person through other people strikes an affirmation of one’s humanity through recognition of an \"other\" in his or her uniqueness and difference. It is a demand for a creative intersubjective formation in which the \"other\" becomes a mirror (but only a mirror) for my subjectivity. This idealism suggests to us that humanity is not embedded in my person solely as an individual; my humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon the other and me. Humanity is a quality we owe to each other. We create each other and need to sustain this otherness creation. And if we belong to each other, we participate in our creations: we are because you are, and since you are, definitely I am . The \"I am\" is not a rigid subject, but a dynamic self-constitution dependent on this otherness creation of relation and distance. [ 8 ]\n",
      "An \"extroverted communities\" aspect is the most visible part of this ideology. There is sincere warmth with which people treat both strangers and members of the community. This overt display of warmth is not merely aesthetic but enables the formation of spontaneous communities. The resultant collaborative work within these spontaneous communities transcends the aesthetic and gives functional significance to the value of warmth. Warmth is not the sine qua non of community formation but guards against instrumentalist relationships. Unfortunately, sincere warmth may leave one vulnerable to those with ulterior motives. [ 9 ]\n",
      "\"Ubuntu\" as political philosophy encourages community equality, propagating the distribution of wealth. This socialisation is a vestige of agrarian peoples as a hedge against the crop failures of individuals. Socialisation presupposes a community population with which individuals empathise and concomitantly, have a vested interest in its collective prosperity. Urbanisation and the aggregation of people into an abstract and bureaucratic state undermines this empathy. African intellectual historians like Michael Onyebuchi Eze have argued, however, that this idea of \"collective responsibility\" must not be understood as absolute in which the community's good is prior to the individual's good. On this view, ubuntu it is argued, is a communitarian philosophy that is widely differentiated from the Western notion of communitarian socialism. In fact, ubuntu induces an ideal of shared human subjectivity that promotes a community's good through an unconditional recognition and appreciation of individual uniqueness and difference. [ 10 ] Audrey Tang has suggested that Ubuntu \"implies that everyone has different skills and strengths; people are not isolated, and through mutual support they can help each other to complete themselves.\" [ 11 ]\n",
      "\"Redemption\" relates to how people deal with errant, deviant, and dissident members of the community. The belief is that man is born formless like a lump of clay. It is up to the community, as a whole, to use the fire of experience and the wheel of social control to mould him into a pot that may contribute to society. Any imperfections should be borne by the community and the community should always seek to redeem man. An example of this is the statement by the African National Congress (in South Africa) that it does not throw out its own but rather redeems.\n",
      "Other scholars such as Mboti (2015) argue that the normative definition of Ubuntu, notwithstanding its intuitive appeal, is still open to doubt. The definition of Ubuntu, contends Mboti, has remained consistently and purposely fuzzy, inadequate and inconsistent. Mboti rejects the interpretation that Africans are \"naturally\" interdependent and harmony-seeking, and that humanity is given to a person by and through other persons. He sees a philosophical trap in attempts to elevate harmony to a moral duty – a sort of categorical imperative – that Africans must simply uphold. Mboti cautions against relying on intuitions in attempts to say what Ubuntu is or is not. He concludes that the phrase umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu references a messier, undisciplined relationship between persons, stating that: \"First, there is value in regarding a broken relationship as being authentically human as much as a harmonious relationship. Second, a broken relationship can be as ethically desirable as a harmonious one. For instance, freedom follows from a break from oppression. Finally, harmonious relations can be as oppressive and false as disharmonious ones. For instance, the cowboy and his horse are in a harmonious relationship.\" [ 12 ]\n",
      "Ubuntu is often presented in short statements called maxims by Samkange (1980). Some of these are: [ 13 ]\n",
      "Ubuntu has been in existence in orature (oral literature) and in the culture of Bantu peoples. It appeared in South African written sources from as early as the mid-19th century. Reported translations covered the semantic field of \"human nature, humanness, humanity; virtue, goodness, kindness\". Grammatically, the word combines the root -ntʊ̀ \"person, human being\" with the class 14 ubu- prefix forming abstract nouns , [ 14 ] so that the term is exactly parallel in formation to the abstract noun humanity . [ 15 ]\n",
      "The concept was popularised in terms of a \" philosophy \" or \" world view \" (as opposed to a quality attributed to an individual) beginning in the 1950s, notably in the writings of Jordan Kush Ngubane published in the African Drum magazine. From the 1970s, the ubuntu began to be described as a specific kind of \"African humanism\". Based on the context of Africanisation propagated by the political thinkers in the 1960s period of decolonisation , ubuntu was used as a term for a specifically African (or Southern African) kind of humanism found in the context of the transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe and South Africa .\n",
      "The first publication dedicated to ubuntu as a philosophical concept appeared in 1980, Hunhuism or Ubuntuism: A Zimbabwe Indigenous Political Philosophy ( hunhu being the Shona equivalent of Nguni ubuntu ) by Stanlake J. W. T. Samkange . Hunhuism or Ubuntuism is presented as political ideology for the new Zimbabwe, as Southern Rhodesia attained independence from the United Kingdom. [ 13 ]\n",
      "The concept was used in South Africa in the 1990s as a guiding ideal for the transition from apartheid to majority rule . The term appears in the Epilogue of the Interim Constitution of South Africa (1993): \"there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for ubuntu but not for victimisation\". [ 16 ]\n",
      "In South Africa, it has come to be used as a contested [ 17 ] term for a kind of humanist philosophy, ethic, or ideology, also known as Ubuntuism propagated in the Africanisation (transition to majority rule) process of these countries during the 1980s and 1990s. New research has begun to question the exclusive \"humanism\" framing, and thus to suggest that ubuntu can have a \"militaristic\" angle – an ubuntu for warriors. [ 18 ]\n",
      "In Uganda the term is used in people's everyday language as a way to relate to one another and call for community. The term can also be used to criticize another's actions if one states that they have lost \"Obuuntu\" (their humanity).\n",
      "Since the transition to democracy in South Africa with the Nelson Mandela presidency in 1994 , the term has become more widely known outside of Southern Africa, notably popularised to English-language readers through the ubuntu theology of Desmond Tutu . [ 19 ] Tutu was the chairman of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), and many have argued that ubuntu was a formative influence on the TRC.\n",
      "In the Shona language , the majority spoken language in Zimbabwe , ubuntu is unhu or hunhu . In Ndebele, it is known as ubuntu. The concept of ubuntu is viewed the same in Zimbabwe as in other African cultures. The Shona phrase munhu munhu nekuda kwevanhu means a person is human through others while ndiri nekuti tiri means I am because we are.\n",
      "Stanlake J. W. T. Samkange (1980) highlights the three maxims of Hunhuism or Ubuntuism that shape this philosophy: The first maxim asserts that 'To be human is to affirm one's humanity by recognizing the humanity of others and, on that basis, establish respectful human relations with them.' And 'the second maxim means that if and when one is faced with a decisive choice between wealth and the preservation of the life of another human being, then one should opt for the preservation of life'. The third 'maxim' as a 'principle deeply embedded in traditional African political philosophy' says 'that the king owed his status, including all the powers associated with it, to the will of the people under him'.

      "A person with Ubuntu is open and available to others, affirming of others, does not feel threatened that others are able and good, based from a proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a greater whole and is diminished when others are humiliated or diminished, when others are tortured or oppressed.\n",
      "Tutu further explained Ubuntu in 2008:. [ 21 ]\n",
      "One of the sayings in our country is Ubuntu - the essence of being human. Ubuntu speaks particularly about the fact that you can't exist as a human being in isolation. It speaks about our interconnectedness. You can't be human all by yourself, and when you have this quality - Ubuntu - you are known for your generosity.\n",
      "We think of ourselves far too frequently as just individuals, separated from one another, whereas you are connected and what you do affects the whole world. When you do well, it spreads out; it is for the whole of humanity. [ unreliable source? ]\n",
      "Nelson Mandela explained Ubuntu as follows: [ 22 ]\n",
      "A traveller through a country would stop at a village and he didn't have to ask for food or for water. Once he stops, the people give him food and attend him. That is one aspect of Ubuntu, but it will have various aspects. Ubuntu does not mean that people should not address themselves. The question therefore is: Are you going to do so in order to enable the community around you to be able to improve?\n",
      "Tim Jackson refers to Ubuntu as a philosophy that supports the changes he says are necessary to create a future that is economically and environmentally sustainable. [ 23 ] Judge Colin Lamont expanded on the definition during his ruling on the hate speech trial of Julius Malema . [ 24 ]\n",
      "At Nelson Mandela's memorial, United States President Barack Obama spoke about Ubuntu, saying,\n",
      "There is a word in South Africa – Ubuntu – a word that captures Mandela's greatest gift:  his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us.\n",
      "We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him, or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell.  But we remember the gestures, large and small – introducing his jailers as honored guests at his inauguration; taking a pitch in a Springbok uniform; turning his family’s heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS – that revealed the depth of his empathy and his understanding.  He not only embodied Ubuntu, he taught millions to find that truth within themselves. [ 25 ]\n",
      "In Malawi , the same philosophy is called \"uMunthu\" in the local Chewa language . [ 26 ] According to the Catholic Diocese of Zomba bishop Rt. Rev. Fr. Thomas Msusa , \"The African worldview is about living as one family, belonging to God\". [ 27 ] Msusa noted that in Africa \"We say 'I am because we are', or in Chichewa kali kokha nkanyama, tili awiri ntiwanthu (when you are on your own you are as good as an animal of the wild; when there are two of you, you form a community).\"\n",
      "The philosophy of uMunthu has been passed on through proverbs such as Mwana wa mnzako ngwako yemwe, ukachenjera manja udya naye (your neighbor's child is your own, his/her success is your success too). [ 27 ] Some notable Malawian uMunthu philosophers and intellectuals who have written about this worldview are Augustine Musopole , Gerard Chigona , Chiwoza Bandawe , Richard Tambulasi , Harvey Kwiyani and Happy Kayuni . This includes Malawian philosopher and theologist Harvey Sindima ’s treatment of uMunthu as an important African philosophy is highlighted in his 1995 book Africa’s Agenda: The legacy of liberalism and colonialism in the crisis of African values . [ 28 ] In film, the English translation of the proverb lent its hand to forming the title of Madonna 's 2008 documentary, I Am Because We Are , about Malawian orphans.\n",
      "In June 2009, in her swearing-in remarks as US Department of State Special Representative for Global Partnerships, Global Partnership Initiative, Office of the Secretary of State, Elizabeth Frawley Bagley discussed ubuntu in the context of American foreign policy , stating: \"In understanding the responsibilities that come with our interconnectedness, we realize that we must rely on each other to lift our World from where it is now to where we want it to be in our lifetime, while casting aside our worn out preconceptions, and our outdated modes of statecraft.\" She then introduced the notion of \"Ubuntu Diplomacy\" with the following words:\n",
      "In 21st-century diplomacy, the Department of State will be a convener, bringing people together from across regions and sectors to work together on issues of common interest. Our work no longer depends on the least common denominator; but rather, we will seek the highest possible multiplier effect for the results we can achieve together.\n",
      "We will also act as a catalyst, with our Foreign Service Officers launching new projects in tandem with those NGOs, philanthropies, and corporations at the front lines of foreign affairs to discover untapped potential, inspire fresh ideas, and create new solutions.\n",
      "And we will act as a collaborator, leading interagency coordination here in Washington and cross-sector collaboration in the field, with our Ambassadors working closely with our non-governmental partners to plan and implement projects for maximum impact and sustainability.\n",
      "It takes a shared, global response to meet the shared, global challenges we face. This is the truth taught to us in an old South African principle, ubuntu, or 'A person is a person through other persons.' As Archbishop Desmond Tutu describes this perspective, ubuntu 'is not, \"I think therefore I am.\" It says rather: \"I am a human because I belong. I participate. I share. \" ' In essence, I am because you are.\n",
      "We are truly all in this together, and we will only succeed by building mutually beneficial partnerships among civil society, the private sector, and the public sector, in order to empower the men and women executing our foreign policy to advance their work through partnerships.\n",
      "The truth and reconciliation council believed in the philosophy of Ubuntu because they believed that Ubuntu was going to help to reform and reconnect the already broken country of South Africa.\n",
      "This is Ubuntu Diplomacy: where all sectors belong as partners, where we all participate as stakeholders, and where we all succeed together, not incrementally but exponentially. [ 29 ]\n",
      "In education, Ubuntu has been used to guide and promote African education, and to decolonise it from Western educational philosophies. [ 30 ] Ubuntu education uses the family, community, society, environment and spirituality as sources of knowledge but also as teaching and learning media. [ 4 ] The essence of education is family, community, societal and environmental well-being. [ 30 ] Ubuntu education is about learners becoming critical about their social conditions. Interaction, participation, recognition, respect and inclusion are important aspects of ubuntu education. Methods of teaching and learning include groups and community approaches. The objectives, content, methodology and outcomes of education are shaped by Ubuntu.\n",
      "This refers to Afrocentric ways of providing a social safety net to vulnerable members of society. Common elements include collectivity. The approach helps to \"validate worldview and traditions suppressed by Western Eurocentric cultural hegemony\". [ 31 ] It is against materialism and individualism. It looks at an individual person as holistically. The social interventions done by social workers, welfare workers and development workers should strengthen, not weaken families, communities, society, the environment and peoples's spirituality. These are the five pillars of ubuntu intervention: family, community, society, environment and spirituality. [ 4 ] Ubuntu is the current theme for the Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development and represents the highest level of global messaging within social work profession for the years 2020–2030. [ 32 ] Utilising the biopsychosocial and ecological system approaches, ubuntu is a philosophy that is applicable in clinical social work in mental health. [ 33 ]\n",
      "Ubuntu can guide research objectives, ethics and methodology. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Using ubuntu research approach provides researchers with an African oriented tool that decolonises research agenda and methodology. [ 34 ] The objectives of ubuntu research are to empower families, communities and society at large. In doing ubuntu research, the position of the researcher is important because it helps create research relationships. The agenda of the research belongs to the community, and true participation is highly valued. Ujamaa is valued, it means pulling together or collaboration. [ 36 ]\n",
      "According to this philosophy, \"actions are right roughly insofar as they are a matter of living harmoniously with others or honouring communal relationships\", \"One's ultimate goal should be to become a full person, a real self or a genuine human being\". Ukama , i.e. relationships are important. [ 37 ] Among the Shona people, for example, when a person dies, his or her property is shared amongst relatives and there are culturally approved ways of doing this. The practice is called kugova . Samkange (1980)'s maxim on morality says \"If and when one is faced with a decisive choice between wealth and the preservation of the life of another human being, then one should opt for the preservation of life\".\n",
      "Samkange (1980) said no foreign political philosophy can be useful in a country more than the indigenous philosophies. [ 13 ] \"Is there a philosophy or ideology indigenous to (a) country that can serve its people just as well, if not better than, foreign ideologies?\", asked Samkange in the book Hunhuism or Ubuntuism . His maxim for leadership is \"The king owes his status, including all the powers associated with it, to the will of the people under him\". [ 13 ] : 7\n",
      "Ubuntu justice has elements different from western societies: it values repairing relationships. Ubuntu justice emphasises these elements: [ 37 ]\n",
      "Families, and at times community are involved in the process of justice.\n",
      "African scholars have noted that while some elements of Ubuntu are liberating to women, others \"marginalize and disempower\" them, and \"can be seen as engendering patriarchy \". [ 38 ]\n",
      "Ubuntu has also been associated with restorative justice. Some scholars have argued that restorative justice practices are embedded in the Ubuntu philosophy which shares similarities with their philosophy, values and practices. [ 39 ] Within the restorative justice context, ubuntu is understood as African humanism, a philosophy, an ethic, and as a worldview. [ 40 ] The underlying restorative justice value of power sharing is very much aligned with the Ubuntu philosophy which \"sees\" the other through their humanity.\n",
      "Ubuntu was a major theme in John Boorman 's 2004 film In My Country . [ 41 ] Former US president Bill Clinton used the term at the 2006 Labour Party conference in the UK to explain why society is important. [ 42 ]\n",
      "The Boston Celtics , the 2008 NBA champions , have chanted \"ubuntu\" when breaking a huddle since the start of the 2007–2008 season . [ 43 ] The first episode of the 2020 Netflix docuseries The Playbook shows how Boston Celtic's coach, Glenn Anton \"Doc\" Rivers learned of the Ubuntu philosophy. The documentary then explores the impact of the philosophy on the team members and how it became their guiding principle. [ 44 ]\n",
      "At the 2002 UN World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), there was an Ubuntu Village exposition centre. [ 45 ] Ubuntu was the theme of the 76th General Convention of the American Episcopal Church . [ 46 ] The logo includes the text \"I in You and You in Me\".\n",
      "First released in October 2004, a prominent computer software package is called the Ubuntu operating system . The operating system development was led by Mark Shuttleworth , a South African entrepreneur and owner of the UK-based company Canonical Ltd. [ 3 ]\n",
      "In film, the English translation of the proverb was used for the title of pop singer Madonna 's 2008 documentary film I Am Because We Are about Malawian orphans. An accompanying book of the same name was published in 2009. [ 47 ]\n",
      "A character in the 2008 animated comedy The Goode Family is named Ubuntu Goode .\n",
      "Ubuntu was the title and theme of an EP released by British band Clockwork Radio in 2012.\n",
      "Ubuntu was the title of an EP released by American rapper Sage Francis in 2012. [ 48 ]\n",
