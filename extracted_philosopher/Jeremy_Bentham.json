However, he viewed the   as important, citing it to argue that the treatment of convicts in Australia was unlawful. Bentham was also a sharp critic of  .\n Bentham's students included his secretary and collaborator  , the latter's son,  , the legal philosopher   and American writer and activist  . He \"had considerable influence on the reform of prisons, schools, poor laws, law courts, and Parliament itself.\" \n On his death in 1832, Bentham left instructions for his body to be first dissected and then to be permanently preserved as an \" \" (or self-image), which would be his memorial. This was done, and the auto-icon is now on public display in the entrance of the Student Centre at   (UCL). Because of his arguments in favour of the general availability of education, he has been described as the \"spiritual founder\" of UCL. However, he played only a limited direct part in its foundation. \n Bentham was born on 4 February     [15 February 1748  ] in  ,  ,  to attorney Jeremiah Bentham and Alicia Woodward, widow of a Mr Whitehorne and daughter of   Thomas Grove, of Andover.  His wealthy family were supporters of the  . He was reportedly a child prodigy: he was found as a toddler sitting at his father's desk reading a multi-volume history of England, and he began to study   at the age of three.  He learnt to play the  , and at the age of seven Bentham would perform   by   during dinner parties.  He had one surviving sibling,   (1757–1831), with whom he was close.\n He attended  ; in 1760, at age 12, his father sent him to  , where he completed his bachelor's degree in 1764, receiving the title of   in 1767.  He trained as a lawyer and, though he never practised, was called to the   in 1769. He became deeply frustrated with the complexity of English law, which he termed the \"Demon of Chicane\".  When the American colonies published their   in July 1776, the British government did not issue any official response but instead secretly commissioned London lawyer and pamphleteer   to publish a rebuttal.  His 130-page tract was distributed in the colonies and contained an essay titled \"Short Review of the Declaration\" written by Bentham, a friend of Lind, which attacked and mocked the Americans'  . \n In 1786 and 1787, Bentham travelled to   in White Russia (modern  ) to visit his brother,  , who was engaged in managing various industrial and other projects for  . It was Samuel (as Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged) who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the hub of a larger compound as a means of allowing a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large and unskilled workforce. \n Bentham began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England.  He supplemented the supervisory principle with the idea of  ; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a   interest in lowering the average rate of mortality. \n The   was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; \"Allow me to construct a prison on this model\", Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, \"I will be the  . You will see ... that the   will have no salary—will cost nothing to the nation.\" As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched. According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour, walking on wheels to spin   or run a  . This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income. \n The ultimately abortive proposal for a panopticon prison to be built in England was one among his many proposals for legal and social reform.  But Bentham spent some sixteen years of his life developing and refining his ideas for the building and hoped that the government would adopt the plan for a National Penitentiary appointing him as contractor-governor. Although the prison was never built, the concept had an important influence on later generations of thinkers. Twentieth-century French philosopher   argued that the panopticon was   of several 19th-century \" \" institutions.  Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite. Philip Schofield argues that it was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of \"sinister interest\"—that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest—which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform. \n On his return to England from Russia, Bentham had commissioned drawings from an architect,  .  In 1791, he published the material he had written as a book, although he continued to refine his proposals for many years to come. He had by now decided that he wanted to see the prison built: when finished, it would be managed by himself as contractor-governor, with the assistance of Samuel. After unsuccessful attempts to interest the authorities in Ireland and revolutionary France,  he started trying to persuade the prime minister,  , to revive an earlier abandoned scheme for a National Penitentiary in England, this time to be built as a panopticon. He was eventually successful in winning over Pitt and his advisors, and in 1794 was paid £2,000 for preliminary work on the project.< \n The intended site was one that had been authorised (under an  ) for the earlier penitentiary, at   Rise; but the new proposals ran into technical legal problems and objections from the local landowner,  .  Other sites were considered, including one at Hanging Wood, near  , but all proved unsatisfactory.  Eventually Bentham turned to a site at Tothill Fields, near  . Although this was common land, with no landowner, there were a number of parties with interests in it, including  , who owned a house on an adjacent site and objected to the idea of a prison overlooking it. Again, therefore, the scheme ground to a halt  At this point, however, it became clear that a nearby site at  , adjoining the  , was available for sale, and this time things ran more smoothly. Using government money, Bentham bought the land on behalf of the Crown for £12,000 in November 1799. \n From his point of view, the site was far from ideal, being marshy, unhealthy, and too small. When he asked the government for more land and more money, however, the response was that he should build only a small-scale experimental prison—which he interpreted as meaning that there was little real commitment to the concept of the panopticon as a cornerstone of penal reform  Negotiations continued, but in 1801 Pitt resigned from office, and in 1803 the new   administration decided not to proceed with the project.  Bentham was devastated: \"They have murdered my best days.\" \n Nevertheless, a few years later the government revived the idea of a National Penitentiary, and in 1811 and 1812 returned specifically to the idea of a panopticon.  Bentham, now aged 63, was still willing to be governor. However, as it became clear that there was still no real commitment to the proposal, he abandoned hope, and instead turned his attentions to extracting financial compensation for his years of fruitless effort. His initial claim was for the enormous sum of nearly £700,000, but he eventually settled for the more modest (but still considerable) sum of £23,000.  The   ( . c. 44) transferred his title in the site to the Crown.\n More successful was his cooperation with   in tackling the corruption in the  . This resulted in the   ( . c. 87)  The Act created the  , which was the first preventive police force in the country and was a precedent for  's reforms 30 years later. \n Bentham was in correspondence with many influential people. In the 1780s, for example, Bentham maintained a correspondence with the ageing  , in an unsuccessful attempt to convince Smith that interest rates should be allowed to freely float.  As a result of his correspondence with   and other leaders of the  , Bentham was declared an honorary citizen of France.  He was an outspoken critic of the revolutionary discourse of   and of the violence that arose after the   took power (1792). Between 1808 and 1810, he held a personal friendship with   revolutionary   and paid visits to Miranda's Grafton Way house in London. He also developed links with  . \n In 1821,   proposed to Bentham that they serve as \"Guardians of Constitutional Reform\", seven \"wise men\" whose reports and observations would \"concern the entire Democracy or Commons of the United Kingdom\". Describing himself, among the names mentioned which also included  ,  , and Sir  , and as a \"nonentity\", Bentham declined the offer. \n On 3 August 1831 the Committee of the National Colonization Society approved the printing of its proposal to establish a free colony on the south coast of Australia, funded by the sale of appropriated colonial lands, overseen by a joint-stock company, and which would be granted powers of self-government as soon as was practicable. Contrary to assumptions, Bentham had no hand in the preparation of the 'Proposal to His Majesty's Government for founding a colony on the Southern Coast of Australia, which was prepared under the auspices of  ,  , and  . Bentham did, however, in August 1831, draft an unpublished work entitled 'Colonization Company Proposal', which constitutes his commentary upon the National Colonization Society's 'Proposal'. \n In 1823, he co-founded   with   as a journal for the \" \"—a group of younger disciples through whom Bentham exerted considerable influence in British public life.  One was  , to whom Bentham became devoted, describing their relationship as \"son and father\": he appointed Bowring political editor of   and eventually his  .  Another was  , who wrote on hygiene, sanitation, and policing and was a major contributor to the  : Bentham employed Chadwick as a secretary and bequeathed him a large legacy. \n Bentham had several infatuations with women, and wrote on sex.  He never married. \n An insight into his character is given in Michael St. John Packe's  :\n A   study by Philip Lucas and Anne Sheeran argues that he may have had  .  \n Bentham's daily pattern was to rise at 6 am, walk for 2 hours or more, and then work until 4 pm. \n The   at   occupies Bentham House, next to the main UCL campus. \n Bentham's name was adopted by the Australian   IMF Limited to become Bentham IMF Limited on 28 November 2013, in recognition of Bentham being \"among the first to support the utility of litigation funding\". \n Bentham today is considered as the \"Father of Utilitarianism\".  His ambition in life was to create a \"Pannomion\", a complete   code of law. He not only proposed many legal and social reforms, but also expounded an underlying moral principle on which they should be based. This philosophy of   took for its \"fundamental axiom\" to be the notion that  .  Bentham claimed to have borrowed this concept from the writings of  ,  although the closest that Priestley in fact came to expressing it was in the form \"the good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great standard by which every thing [ ] relating to that state must finally be determined.\" \n Bentham was a rare major figure in the history of philosophy to endorse  .  He was also a determined opponent of religion, as Crimmins observes: \"Between 1809 and 1823 Jeremy Bentham carried out an exhaustive examination of religion with the declared aim of extirpating religious beliefs, even the idea of religion itself, from the minds of men.\" \n Bentham also suggested a procedure for estimating the   of any action, which he called the   or  .\n \n The principle of utility, or \" \", forms the cornerstone of all Bentham's thought. By \"happiness\", he understood a predominance of \"pleasure\" over \"pain\". He wrote in  : \n Bentham's   focuses on the principle of utility and how this view of morality ties into legislative practices.  His principle of utility regards   as that which produces the greatest amount of pleasure and the minimum amount of pain and   as that which produces the most pain without the pleasure. This concept of   is defined by Bentham as physical as well as spiritual. Bentham writes about this principle as it manifests itself within the legislation of a society. \n In order to measure the extent of pain or pleasure that a certain decision will create, he lays down a set of criteria divided into the categories of  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .  Using these measurements, he reviews the concept of punishment and when it should be used as far as whether a punishment will create more pleasure or more pain for a society.\n He calls for legislators to determine whether punishment creates an even more evil offence. Instead of suppressing the evil acts, Bentham argues that certain unnecessary laws and punishments could ultimately lead to new and more dangerous vices than those being punished to begin with, and calls upon legislators to measure the pleasures and pains associated with any legislation and to form laws in order to create the greatest good for the greatest number. He argues that the concept of the individual pursuing his or her own happiness cannot be necessarily declared \"right\", because often these individual pursuits can lead to greater pain and less pleasure for a society as a whole. Therefore, the legislation of a society is vital to maintain the maximum pleasure and the minimum degree of pain for the greatest number of people. \n In his exposition of the  , Bentham proposed a classification of 12 pains and 14 pleasures, by which we might test the \" \" of any action.  For Bentham, according to P. J. Kelly, the law \"provides the basic framework of social interaction by delimiting spheres of personal inviolability within which individuals can form and pursue their own conceptions of well-being\".  It provides security, a precondition for the formation of expectations. As the hedonic calculus shows \"expectation utilities\" to be much higher than natural ones, it follows that Bentham does not favour the sacrifice of a few to the benefit of the many. Law professor   has quoted Bentham to argue that torture should sometimes be permitted. \n Utilitarianism was revised and expanded by Bentham's student  , who sharply criticised Bentham's view of human nature, which failed to recognise conscience as a human motive. Mill considered Bentham's view \"to have done and to be doing very serious evil.\"  In Mill's hands, \"Benthamism\" became a major element in the   conception of   objectives.\n Bentham's critics have claimed that he undermined the foundation of a free society by rejecting  .  Historian   wrote \"The principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number was as inimical to the idea of liberty as to the idea of rights.\" \n Bentham's \"hedonistic\" theory (a term from  ) is often criticised for lacking a principle of fairness embodied in a conception of  . In  , Gerald J. Postema states: \"No moral concept suffers more at Bentham's hand than the concept of justice. There is no sustained, mature analysis of the notion.\"  Thus, some critics  object, it would be acceptable to   one person if this would produce an amount of happiness in other people outweighing the unhappiness of the tortured individual. However, as P. J. Kelly argued in  , Bentham had a theory of justice that prevented such consequences. \n Bentham's opinions about   were completely different from those of  ; however, they had some similarities to those of  . He focused on   as a means of helping to create  . He was also aware of the relevance of forced saving,  , the saving-investment relationship, and other matters that form the content of modern income and employment analysis. His monetary view was close to the fundamental concepts employed in his model of utilitarian decision making. His work is considered to be an early precursor of modern  . \n Bentham stated that pleasures and pains can be ranked according to their value or \"dimension\" such as intensity, duration, certainty of a pleasure or a pain. He was concerned with maxima and minima of pleasures and pains; and they set a precedent for the future employment of the maximisation principle in the economics of the consumer, the firm and the search for an optimum in welfare economics. \n Bentham advocated \"Pauper Management\" which involved the creation of a chain of large workhouses. \n  described Bentham as \"a genius of bourgeois stupidity\". \n Bentham was the first person to be an aggressive advocate for the   of   of the   into a coherent set of statutes; he was actually the person who coined the verb \"to codify\" to refer to the process of drafting a legal code.  He lobbied hard for the formation of codification commissions in both England and the United States, and went so far as to write to President   in 1811 to volunteer to write a complete legal code for the young country. After he learned more about American law and realised that most of it was state-based, he promptly wrote to the governors of every single state with the same offer. \n During his lifetime, Bentham's codification efforts were completely unsuccessful. Even today, they have been completely rejected by almost every common law jurisdiction, including England.  However, his writings on the subject laid the foundation for the moderately successful codification work of   in the United States a generation later. \n \nBentham is widely regarded as one of the earliest proponents of  .  He argued and believed that the ability to suffer, not the ability to reason, should be the benchmark, or what he called the \"insuperable line\". If reason alone were the criterion by which we judge who ought to have rights, human infants and adults with certain forms of disability might fall short, too.  In 1780, alluding to the limited degree of legal protection afforded to   in the   by the  , he wrote: Earlier in the paragraph, Bentham makes clear that he accepted that animals could be killed for food, or in defence of human life, provided that the animal was not made to suffer unnecessarily. Bentham did not object to  , providing that the experiments had in mind a particular goal of benefit to humanity, and had a reasonable chance of achieving that goal. He wrote that otherwise he had a \"decided and insuperable objection\" to causing pain to animals, in part because of the harmful effects such practices might have on human beings. In a letter to the editor of the   in March 1825, he wrote:\n Bentham said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose in 1759, at the age of eleven, the career of a reformist,  though American critic   claimed to have convinced him to take up women's rights issues during their association between 1825 and 1827.  Bentham spoke for a complete equality between the sexes, arguing in favour of  , a woman's right to obtain a divorce, and a woman's right to hold political office.\n The   essay \"Paederasty (Offences Against One's Self)\"  argued for the   of laws prohibiting homosexual sex.  The essay remained unpublished during his lifetime for fear of offending public morality. Some of Bentham's writings on \"sexual non-conformity\" were published for the first time in 1931,  but   was not published until 1978.  Bentham does not believe homosexual acts to be unnatural, describing them merely as \"irregularities of the venereal appetite\". The essay chastises the society of the time for making a disproportionate response to what Bentham appears to consider a largely private offence—public displays or forced acts being dealt with rightly by other laws. When the essay was published in the   in 1978, the   stated that Bentham's essay was the \"first known argument for homosexual law reform in England\". \n Bentham's writings in the early 1790s onwards expressed an opposition to  . His 1793 pamphlet   critiqued French colonialism. In the early 1820s, he argued that the liberal government in Spain should emancipate its New World colonies. In the essay  , Bentham argued that Britain should emancipate its New World colonies and abandon its colonial ambitions. He argued that empire was bad for the greatest number in the metropole and the colonies. According to Bentham, empire was financially unsound, entailed taxation on the poor in the metropole, caused unnecessary expansion in the military apparatus, undermined the security of the metropole, and were ultimately motivated by misguided ideas of honour and glory. \n For Bentham, transparency had moral value. For example, journalism puts power-holders under moral scrutiny. However, Bentham wanted such transparency to apply to everyone. This he describes by picturing the world as a gymnasium in which each \"gesture, every turn of limb or feature, in those whose motions have a visible impact on the general happiness, will be noticed and marked down\".  He considered both surveillance and transparency to be useful ways of generating understanding and improvements for people's lives. \n Bentham distinguished among fictional entities what he called \"fabulous entities\" like   or a  , from what he termed \"fictitious entities\", or necessary objects of discourse, similar to  's categories,  such as nature, custom, or the social contract. \n Bentham died on 6 June 1832, aged 84, at his residence in Queen Square Place in  , London. He had continued to write up to a month before his death, and had made careful preparations for the   of his body after death and its preservation as an auto-icon. As early as 1769, when Bentham was 21 years old, he made a will leaving his body for dissection to a family friend, the physician and chemist  , whose daughter, Maria Sophia (1765–1858), married Jeremy's brother  .  A paper written in 1830, instructing   to create the auto-icon, was attached to his last will, dated 30 May 1832.  It stated:\n Bentham's wish to preserve his dead body was consistent with his philosophy of utilitarianism. In his essay  , Bentham wrote, \"If a country gentleman has rows of trees leading to his dwelling, the auto-icons of his family might alternate with the trees; copal varnish would protect the face from the effects of rain.\"  On 8 June 1832, two days after his death, invitations were distributed to a select group of friends, and on the following day at 3 p.m., Southwood Smith delivered a lengthy oration over Bentham's remains in the Webb Street School of Anatomy & Medicine in  , London. The printed oration contains a frontispiece with an engraving of Bentham's body partly covered by a sheet. \n Afterward, the skeleton and head were preserved and stored in a wooden cabinet called the \"auto-icon\", with the skeleton padded out with hay and dressed in Bentham's clothes. From 1833, it stood in Southwood Smith's   consulting rooms until he abandoned private practice in the winter of 1849–50, when it was moved to 36  , the studio of his unofficial partner, painter  , who made studies of it. In March 1850, Southwood Smith offered the auto-icon to  , who readily accepted it for  . \n It is currently kept on public display at the main entrance of the UCL Student Centre. It was previously displayed at the end of the South Cloisters in the main building of the college until it was moved in 2020. Upon the retirement of Sir   as   of the college in 2013, however, the body was present at Grant's final council meeting. As of 2013, this was the only time that the body of Bentham has been taken to a UCL council meeting.  (There is a persistent myth that the body of Bentham is present at all council meetings.) \n Bentham had intended the auto-icon to incorporate his actual head,   to resemble its appearance in life. Southwood Smith's experimental efforts at mummification, based on practices of the indigenous peoples of   and involving placing the head under an air pump over sulfuric acid and drawing off the fluids, although technically successful, left the head looking distastefully macabre, with dried and darkened skin stretched tautly over the skull. \n The auto-icon was therefore given a   head, fitted with some of Bentham's own hair. The real head was displayed in the same case as the auto-icon for many years, but became the target of repeated  . It was later locked away.  \n In 2020, the auto-icon was put into a new glass display case and moved to the entrance of UCL's new Student Centre on  . \n Bentham is widely associated with the foundation in 1826 of London University (the institution that, in 1836, became  ), though he was 78 years old when the university opened and played only an indirect role in its establishment. His direct involvement was limited to his buying a single £100 share in the new university, making him just one of over a thousand shareholders. \n Bentham and his ideas can nonetheless be seen as having inspired several of the actual founders of the university. He strongly believed that education should be more widely available, particularly to those who were not wealthy or who did not belong to the established church; in Bentham's time, membership of the   and the capacity to bear considerable expenses were required of students entering the Universities of   and  . As the University of London was the first in England to admit all, regardless of  , creed or political belief, it was largely consistent with Bentham's vision. There is some evidence that, from the sidelines, he played a \"more than passive part\" in the planning discussions for the new institution, although it is also apparent that \"his interest was greater than his influence\".  He failed in his efforts to see his disciple   appointed professor of English or History, but he did oversee the appointment of another pupil,  , as the first professor of   in 1829.\n The more direct associations between Bentham and UCL—the college's custody of his Auto-icon (see above) and of the majority of his surviving papers—postdate his death by some years: the papers were donated in 1849, and the Auto-icon in 1850. A large painting by   hanging in UCL's   depicts Bentham approving the plans of the new university, but it was executed in 1922 and the scene is entirely imaginary. Since 1959 (when the Bentham Committee was first established), UCL has hosted the Bentham Project, which is progressively publishing a  .\n UCL now endeavours to acknowledge Bentham's influence on its foundation, while avoiding any suggestion of direct involvement, by describing him as its \"spiritual founder\". \n Bentham was an obsessive writer and reviser, but was only able on rare occasions of bringing his work to completion and publication.  Most of what appeared in print in his lifetime  was prepared for publication by others. Several of his works first appeared in French translation, prepared for the press by  , for example,  , Volume 2 ( ) 1840, Weeks, Jordan, & Company. Boston. Some made their first appearance in English in the 1820s as a result of back-translation from Dumont's 1802 collection (and redaction) of Bentham's writing on civil and penal legislation.\n On his death, Bentham left manuscripts amounting to an estimated 30 million words, which are now largely held by   (     ) and the   (  folios). University College London also holds a collection of c.500 books either by, about, or owned by Jeremy Bentham. \n , the young radical writer who had been Bentham's intimate friend and disciple, was appointed his   and charged with the task of preparing a collected edition of his works. This appeared in 11 volumes in 1838–1843. Bowring based much of his edition on previously published texts (including those of Dumont) rather than Bentham's own manuscripts, and elected not to publish Bentham's works on religion at all. The edition was described by the   on first publication as \"incomplete, incorrect and ill-arranged\", and has since been repeatedly criticised both for its omissions and for errors of detail; while Bowring's memoir of Bentham's life included in volumes 10 and 11 was described by Sir   as \"one of the worst biographies in the language\".  Nevertheless, Bowring's remained the standard edition of most of Bentham's writings for over a century, and is still only partially superseded: it includes such interesting writings on international  relations as Bentham's   written 1786–89, which forms part IV of the  .\n In 1952–1954,   published a three-volume set,  , in which he attempted to bring together all of Bentham's writings on economic matters, including both published and unpublished material. Although a significant achievement, the work is considered by scholars to be flawed in many points of detail,  and a new edition of the economic writings (retitled  ) is currently in course of publication by the Bentham Project.\n In 1959, the Bentham Committee was established under the auspices of University College London with the aim of producing a definitive edition of Bentham's writings. It set up the Bentham Project  to undertake the task, and the first volume in   was published in 1968. The   are providing many unpublished works, as well as much-improved texts of works already published. To date, 38 volumes have appeared; the complete edition is projected to total 80.  The volume   (1970) was found to contain many errors and has been replaced by   (2010)  In 2017, Volumes 1–5 were re-published in open access by UCL Press. \n To assist in this task, the Bentham papers at UCL are being digitised by crowdsourcing their transcription.   is a   manuscript transcription project, run by  's Bentham Project,  in partnership with UCL's  , UCL Library Services, UCL Learning and Media Services, the  , and the online community.
