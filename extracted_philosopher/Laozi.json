A   typically translated as \"the Old Master (zi)\", the name and text were likely intended to portray an archaic anonymity that could converse with  . Modern scholarship generally regards his biographical details as later inventions, and his opus a collaboration. Traditional accounts addend him as  ,  born in the 6th century BC   of   during China's  . Serving as the royal   for the   court at   (in modern  ), he met and impressed   on one occasion, composing the   in a single session before retiring into the western wilderness.\n A central figure in  , Laozi is generally considered the founder of Taoism. He was claimed and   as the ancestor of the 7th–10th century   and is similarly honored in modern China as the progenitor of the popular  . In some sects of Taoism,  ,  , and  , it is held that he then became an    .  Certain Taoist devotees held that the   was the avatar – embodied as a book – of the god  , one of the   of the Taoist pantheon, though few philosophers believe this.  \n The   had a profound influence on   and on subsequent Chinese philosophers, who annotated, commended, and criticized the texts extensively. In the 20th century,   by   led to theories questioning Laozi's timing or even existence, positing that the received text of the   was not composed until the 4th century BC  , and was the product of multiple authors.\n \n Laozi   is the modern pinyin   of  . It is not a personal name, but rather an  , meaning 'old' or 'venerable'. Its structure matches that of other ancient Chinese philosophers, such as  ,  , and  .  \n Traditional accounts give Laozi the personal name   ( ,  ), whose   pronunciation   as  .    is a common   which also has the meaning meaning ' ' or plum tree when used as a common noun; there is a legend tying Laozi's birth to a plum tree.  Laozi has long been identified with the persona   ( ,  ).    similarly means \"Long-Ear\" or \"the Long-Eared One\". The character   is the Chinese word for 'ear'.  \n Laozi is recorded bearing the     ( ,  ), whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as  .  The character   was the title of the eldest son born to the primary wife, or an uncle of the father's family who was older than one's father, also used as a   indicating an aristocratic lineage head with rulership over a small to medium domain, and as a general mark of respect. The character   is  , the solar and masculine life force in Taoist belief. Lao Dan seems to have been used more generally, however, including by   in his  ,  in the  ,  and by some modern scholars. \n By the mid-twentieth century, consensus had emerged among Western scholars that the   of a person known as Laozi is doubtful and that the   is \"a compilation of Taoist sayings by many hands\",  with an author being invented afterwards.  While multiple authorship over time is typical for early Chinese texts,  the book's conspicuous absence of a central Master figure place it in marked contrast with nearly all other early Chinese philosophical works. \n As of 2024 , the oldest manuscript containing text from the   dates to the late 4th century BC, written on   excavated as part of the  . These passages correspond with roughly one third of the received text,  and some are placed in the same order. These are mixed in with passages not carried by the transmitted  , indicating that its makeup was still undergoing revisions and modifications.  The oldest manuscripts of the   in a complete form by itself were discovered at a tomb in  , and date to the early 2nd century BCE.  Analysis of early commentary on passages that appear in the received   supports an accretionary evolution for the text rather than a singular authorship event. \n The earliest biographical reference to Laozi is found in the 1st‑century BC   by  . Multiple accounts of Laozi's biography are presented, with Sima Qian expressing various levels of doubt in his sources.  \n In one account, Sima Qian reports that Laozi was said to be a contemporary of Confucius during the 6th or 5th century BC. His personal name was Er or Dan. He was born in the village of Quren ( ,  ) in the southern  ,  within present-day   in  .  He was said to be the son of the Censor-in-Chief of the   and Lady Yishou ( ), and was a scholar who worked as the Keeper of the Archives for the royal Zhou court. This reportedly allowed him broad access to the works of the   and other classics of the time, and wrote a book in two parts before departing to the west.\n In another, Laozi was a different contemporary of Confucius called   ( ), one of  , and wrote a book in 15 parts. The story tells of Zong the Warrior who defeats an enemy and triumphs, and then abandons the corpses of the enemy soldiers to be eaten by vultures. By coincidence Laozi, traveling and teaching the way of the Tao, comes on the scene and is revealed to be the father of Zong, from whom he was separated in childhood. Laozi tells his son that it is better to treat respectfully a beaten enemy, and that the disrespect to their dead would cause his foes to seek revenge. Convinced, Zong orders his soldiers to bury the enemy dead. Funeral mourning is held for the dead of both parties and a lasting peace is made.\n In a third, he was the court astrologer Lao Dan who lived during the 4th century BC reign of the   who grew weary of the moral decay of life in   and noted the kingdom's decline. He ventured west to live as a hermit in the unsettled frontier at the age of 80. At the western gate of the city (or kingdom), he was recognized by the guard  . The sentry asked the old master to record his wisdom for the good of the country before he would be permitted to pass. The text Laozi wrote was said to be the  , although the present version of the text includes additions from later periods. In some versions of the tale, the sentry was so touched by the work that he became a disciple and left with Laozi, never to be seen again.  In some later interpretations, the \"Old Master\" journeyed all the way to India and was the teacher of Siddartha Gautama,  . Others say he was the Buddha himself. \n The stories assert that Laozi never opened a formal school but nonetheless attracted a large number of students and loyal disciples. There are many variations of a story retelling his encounter with Confucius, most famously in the  .    suggested that the Confucian version of the story presented in the   was the original, which was borrowed and re-interpreted by the followers of  .  His birthday is popularly held to be the 15th day of the second month of the  .  In accounts where Laozi married, he was said to have had a son who became a celebrated soldier of   during the  .\n The   is one of the most significant treatises in Chinese  . It is often called the  , and has always been associated with that name. The identity of the person or people who wrote or compiled the text has been the source of considerable speculation and debate throughout history.  As with many works of ancient  , ideas are often explained by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. The   stands as an exemplar of this literary form.  Unlike most works of its genre, the book conspicuously lacks a central \"master\" character and seldom references historical people or events, giving it an air of timelessness. \n The   describes the Tao as the source and ideal of all existence: it is unseen, but not transcendent, immensely powerful yet supremely humble, being the root of all things. People have desires and free will (and thus are able to alter their own nature). Many act \"unnaturally\", upsetting the natural balance of the Tao. The   intends to lead students to a \"return\" to their natural state, in harmony with Tao.  Language and conventional wisdom are critically assessed. Taoism views them as inherently biased and artificial, widely using paradoxes to sharpen the point. \n , literally 'non-action' or 'not acting', is a central concept of the  . The concept of   is multifaceted, and reflected in the words' multiple meanings, even in English translation; it can mean \"not doing anything\", \"not forcing\", \"not acting\" in the theatrical sense, \"creating nothingness\", \"acting spontaneously\", and \"flowing with the moment\". \n This concept is used to explain  , or harmony with the Tao. It includes the concepts that value distinctions are ideological and seeing ambition of all sorts as originating from the same source.   used the term broadly with simplicity and humility as key virtues, often in contrast to selfish action. On a political level, it means avoiding such circumstances as war, harsh laws and heavy taxes. Some Taoists see a connection between   and   practices, such as   ('sitting in oblivion': emptying the mind of bodily awareness and thought) found in the  . \n Alan Chan provides an example of how Laozi encouraged a change in approach, or return to \"nature\", rather than action. Technology may bring about a false sense of progress. The answer provided by Laozi is not the rejection of technology, but instead seeking the calm state of  , free from desires. This relates to many statements by Laozi encouraging rulers to keep their people in \"ignorance\", or \"simple-minded\". Some scholars insist this explanation ignores the religious context, and others question it as an   of the philosophical coherence of the text. It would not be unusual political advice if Laozi literally intended to tell rulers to keep their people ignorant. However, some terms in the text, such as \"valley spirit\" ( ,  ) and 'soul' ( ,  ), bear a metaphysical context and cannot be easily reconciled with a purely ethical reading of the work. \n Potential officials throughout Chinese history drew on the authority of non-Confucian sages, especially Laozi and  , to deny serving any ruler at any time. Zhuangzi, the other founder of Taoism, had a great deal of influence on Chinese   and culture.  Political theorists influenced by Laozi have advocated humility in leadership and a restrained approach to statecraft, either for ethical and pacifist reasons, or for tactical ends. In a different context, various   have embraced Laozi's teachings on the power of the weak. \n The story of Laozi has taken on strong religious overtones since the  . As   took root, Laozi was worshipped as a god. Belief in the revelation of the Tao from the divine Laozi resulted in the formation of the  , the first organized religious Taoist sect. In later Taoist tradition, Laozi came to be seen as a personification of the Tao. He is said to have undergone numerous \"transformations\" and taken on guises in various incarnations throughout history to initiate the faithful in the Way. Religious Taoism often holds that the \"Old Master\" did not disappear after writing the   but rather spent his life traveling and revealing the Tao. \n  state that Laozi was a  , conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He supposedly remained in her womb for 62 years before being born while his mother was leaning against a plum tree.  Laozi was said to have emerged as a grown man with a full grey beard and long earlobes, both symbols of wisdom and long life.  Other myths state that he was   13 times after his first life during the days of  . In his last incarnation as Laozi, he lived 990 years and spent his life traveling to reveal the Tao. \n Due to his traditional name  , Laozi has been   as the ancestor of all subsequent  , and many clans of the Li family trace their descent to Laozi,  including the   of the  .  This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage ( ). According to the Simpkinses, while many (if not all) of these lineages are questionable, they provide a testament to Laozi's impact on Chinese culture.  Under the  , Laozi received a series of   of increasing grandeur. In the year 666,   named Laozi the \"Supremely Mysterious and Primordial Emperor\"    ).  In 743,   declared him the \"   \"    ) of the dynasty with the posthumous title of \"Mysterious and Primordial Emperor\"    ). Emperor Xuanzong also elevated Laozi's parents to the ranks of \"Innately Supreme Emperor\"    ) and \"Innate Empress\"    ). In 749, Laozi was further honored as the \"Sage Ancestor and Mysterious and Primordial Emperor of the Great Way\"    ) and then, in 754, as the \"Great Sage Ancestor and Mysterious and Primordial Heavenly Emperor and Great Sovereign of the Golden Palace of the High and Supreme Great Way\"    ).\n A seventh-century work, the   ( ; \"Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns\"), presents Laozi is the perfect Taoist master and a character named   as the ideal Taoist student. Yinxi follows a formal sequence of preparation, testing, training and attainment. \n In the   tradition of  , the greatly revered Siddhar  , one of the 18 esteemed Siddhars of yore, is believed to be Laozi and is of Chinese origin. His caste, from obscure references is noted to be \"Cinatecakkuyavar\" or Chinese potter. In his principal book of poetry, the  , he tells of his travels to China to spread his ideas on spirituality, specifically on the topic of sublimating the sexual energies and using said energies to become self-realised, with a spiritually-minded partner.  His     can be found in the southwestern corridor of the  ,  ,  , Tamil Nadu. \n Many contemporary philosophers have seen Laozi as a proponent of limited government.  The   economist   suggested that Laozi was the first  ,  likening Laozi's ideas on government to  's theory of  .  James A. Dorn agreed, writing that Laozi, like many 18th-century liberals, \"argued that minimizing the role of government and letting individuals develop spontaneously would best achieve social and economic harmony.\"  Similarly, the  's   includes passages from the   in his 1997 book   and noted in an article for the   that Laozi advocated for rulers to \"do nothing\" because \"without law or compulsion, men would dwell in harmony.\"  Philosopher Roderick Long argues that libertarian themes in Taoist thought are actually borrowed from earlier   writers. \n The   writer and activist   praised Laozi's \"gentle wisdom\" and understanding of the opposition between political power and the cultural activities of the people and community in his 1937 book  .  In his 1910 article for the  ,   also noted that Laozi was among the earliest proponents of essentially   concepts.  More recently, anarchists such as John P. Clark and   have written about the conjunction between anarchism and Taoism in various ways, highlighting the teachings of Laozi in particular.  In her rendition of the Tao Te Ching, Le Guin writes that Laozi \"does not see political power as magic. He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped... He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anyone who follows the Way. No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends.\" \n"}
