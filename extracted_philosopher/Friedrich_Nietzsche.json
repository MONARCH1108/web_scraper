He began his career as a   before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest person to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the   in Switzerland in 1869, at the age of 24, but resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties, with   and probably  . He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897, and then with his sister  .

He also developed influential concepts such as the   and his doctrine of  . In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome cultural and moral mores in pursuit of   and aesthetic health. His body of work touched a wide range of topics, including  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  , and drew inspiration from   as well as figures such as  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .\n After his death, Nietzsche's sister   became the curator and editor of his manuscripts. She edited his unpublished writings to fit her   ideology, often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly  . Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with   and  . 20th-century scholars such as  ,  , and   defended Nietzsche against this interpretation, and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available. Nietzsche's thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th- and early 21st-century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of   such as  ,  , and  —as well as art, literature, music, poetry, politics, and popular culture.\n \nBorn on 15 October 1844, Nietzsche  grew up in the town of   (now part of  ), near  , in the Prussian  . He was named after King  , who turned 49 on the day of Nietzsche's birth (Nietzsche later dropped his middle name Wilhelm). Nietzsche's great-grandfather,   (1714–1804), was an inspector and a philosopher. Nietzsche's grandfather,   (1756–1826), was a theologian.   Nietzsche's parents,   (1813–1849), a   pastor  and former teacher; and   (  Oehler) (1826–1897), married in 1843, the year before their son's birth. They had two other children: a daughter,  , born in 1846; and a second son, Ludwig Joseph, born in 1848. Nietzsche's father died from a brain disease in 1849, after a year of excruciating agony, when the boy was only four years old; Ludwig Joseph died six months later at age two.  The family then moved to  , where they lived with Nietzsche's maternal grandmother and his father's two unmarried sisters. After the death of Nietzsche's grandmother in 1856, the family moved into their own house, now  , a museum and Nietzsche study centre.\n Nietzsche attended a boys' school and then a private school, where he became friends with Gustav Krug and Wilhelm Pinder, all three of whom came from highly respected families. Academic records from one of the schools attended by Nietzsche noted that he excelled in  . \n In 1854, he began to attend the Domgymnasium in Naumburg. Because his father had worked for the state (as a pastor) the now-fatherless Nietzsche was offered a scholarship to study at the internationally recognised  . The claim that Nietzsche was admitted on the strength of his academic competence has been debunked: his grades were not near the top of the class.  He studied there from 1858 to 1864, becoming friends with   and Carl von Gersdorff (1844–1904), who later became a jurist. He also found time to work on poems and musical compositions. Nietzsche led \"Germania\", a music and literature club, during his summers in Naumburg.  At Schulpforta, Nietzsche received an important grounding in languages— ,  ,  , and French—so as to be able to read important  ;  he also experienced for the first time being away from his family life in a small-town conservative environment. His end-of-semester exams in March 1864   in Religion and German; a 2a in Greek and Latin; a 2b in French, History, and Physics; and a \"lackluster\" 3 in Hebrew and Mathematics. \n Nietzsche was an amateur composer.  He composed several works for voice, piano, and violin beginning in 1858 at the Schulpforta in Naumburg when he started to work on musical compositions.   was dismissive of Nietzsche's music, allegedly mocking a birthday gift of a piano composition sent by Nietzsche in 1871 to Wagner's wife  . German conductor and pianist   also described another of Nietzsche's pieces as \"the most undelightful and the most anti-musical draft on musical paper that I have faced in a long time\". \n While at Schulpforta, Nietzsche pursued subjects that were considered unbecoming. He became acquainted with the work of the then almost-unknown poet  , calling him \"my favorite poet\" and writing an essay in which he said that the poet raised consciousness to \"the most sublime ideality\".  The teacher who corrected the essay gave it a good mark but commented that Nietzsche should concern himself in the future with healthier, more lucid, and more \"German\" writers. Additionally, he became acquainted with  , an eccentric,  , and often   poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young Nietzsche but who may have introduced Nietzsche to the music and writing of  .  Perhaps under Ortlepp's influence, he and a student named Richter returned to school drunk and encountered a teacher, resulting in Nietzsche's demotion from first in his class and the end of his status as a  . \n After graduation in September 1864,  Nietzsche began studying theology and classical philology at the   in the hope of becoming a  . For a short time, he and Deussen became members of the    . After one semester (and to the anger of his mother), he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith.  As early as his 1862 essay \"Fate and History\", Nietzsche had argued that historical research had discredited the central teachings of Christianity,  but  's   also seems to have had a profound effect on the young man.  In addition,  's   influenced young Nietzsche with its argument that people created God, and not the other way around.  In June 1865, at the age of 20, Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth, who was deeply religious, a letter regarding his loss of faith. This letter contains the following statement:\n Nietzsche subsequently concentrated on studying philology under Professor  , whom he followed to the   in 1865.  There he became close friends with his fellow student  . Nietzsche's first philological publications appeared soon after.\n In 1865, Nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of  . He owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading Schopenhauer's   and later admitted that Schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers whom he respected, dedicating the essay \" \" in the   to him.\n In 1866, he read  's  . Lange's descriptions of  's anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of European  , Europe's increased concern with science,  's theory of  , and the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued Nietzsche greatly. Nietzsche would ultimately argue the impossibility of an evolutionary explanation of the human aesthetic sense. \n In 1867, Nietzsche signed up for one year of   with the   in Naumburg. He was regarded as one of the finest   among his fellow recruits, and his officers predicted that he would soon reach the rank of  . However, in March 1868, while   of his horse, Nietzsche struck his chest against the   and   in his left side, leaving him exhausted and unable to walk for months.  Consequently, he turned his attention to his studies again, completing them in 1868. Nietzsche also met   for the first time later that year. \n \n In 1869, with Ritschl's support, Nietzsche received an offer to become a professor of   at the   in Switzerland. He was only 24 years old and had neither completed his doctorate nor received a teaching certificate (\" \"). He was awarded an   by   in March 1869, again with Ritschl's support. \n Despite his offer coming at a time when he was considering giving up philology for science, he accepted.  To this day, Nietzsche is still among the youngest of the tenured Classics professors on record. \n Nietzsche's 1870 projected  , \"Contribution toward the Study and the Critique of the Sources of Diogenes Laertius\" (\" \"), examined the origins of the ideas of  .  Though never submitted, it was later published as a   ('congratulatory publication') in  . \n Before moving to Basel, Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship: for the rest of his life he remained officially  . \n Nevertheless, Nietzsche served in the Prussian forces during the   (1870–1871) as a medical  . In his short time in the military, he experienced much and witnessed the traumatic effects of battle. He also contracted   and  .    speculates that he also contracted   at a brothel along with his other infections at this time.  On returning to Basel in 1870, Nietzsche observed the establishment of the   and  's subsequent policies as an outsider and with a degree of scepticism regarding their genuineness. His inaugural lecture at the university was \" \". Nietzsche also met  , a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life.  , a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873   and Nietzsche's colleague, the historian  , whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him. \n Nietzsche had already met Richard Wagner in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner's wife, Cosima. Nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner's house in   in  . The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle—which included  , of whom Nietzsche colloquially described: \"Liszt or the art of running after women!\"  Nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the  . In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of \"The Genesis of the Tragic Idea\" as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book,  . However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favour of a more speculative approach. In his    ,   damped the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in  ) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defence. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel.\n In 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as  . Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: \" : the Confessor and the Writer\", \" \", \"Schopenhauer as Educator\", and \"Richard Wagner in Bayreuth\". These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title  . The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time in the circle of the Wagners, he met   and  . He also began a friendship with   who, in 1876, influenced him into dismissing the   in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the   of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of \"German culture\", which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms, as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.\n With the publication in 1878 of   (a book of   ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by  's   and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel and was pensioned.  Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind,   headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.\n \n Living on his pension from Basel along with aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health. He lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in   near   in Switzerland, and many of his winters in the Italian cities of  ,  , and   and the French city of  . In 1881, when  , he planned to travel to   to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons.  Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and   had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.\n While in  , Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of   as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the  , a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his,  , became a private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche's first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.  He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work. On at least one occasion, on 23 February 1880, the usually poor Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul Rée.  Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticise him. In responding most enthusiastically to   (\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\"), Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as \"superfluous\" people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people  , for example, had to rely on to supply his simple diet of goat cheese. \n To the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends.   remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic Carl Fuchs. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with   in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.\n In 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of  . That year he also met  ,  through Malwida von Meysenbug and  .\n Salomé's mother took her to Rome when Salomé was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salomé became acquainted with  . Rée proposed marriage to her, but she, instead, proposed that they should live and study together as \"brother and sister\", along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune.  Rée accepted the idea and suggested that they be joined by his friend Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salomé, as Rée had done. Nietzsche asked Rée to propose marriage to Salomé, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband.  Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join with Rée and Salomé touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune. The three travelled with Salomé's mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their \"Winterplan\" commune. They intended to set up their commune in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found. On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salomé, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. He nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune.  After discovering the relationship, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from the \"immoral woman\".  Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in   in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Salomé reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events is questionable.  Arriving in   (Germany) in October, Salomé and Rée separated from Nietzsche after a falling-out between Nietzsche and Salomé, in which Salomé believed that Nietzsche was desperately in love with her.\n While the three spent a number of weeks together in Leipzig in October 1882, the following month Rée and Salomé left Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe (today   in Poland)  without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to Rée, stating \"We shall see one another from time to time, won't we?\"  In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo Salomé on Salomé, Rée, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the families of Salomé and Rée to disrupt the plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt \"genuine hatred for my sister\". \n Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of   in only ten days.\n By 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of   and continued to have trouble sleeping.  In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative  , signing them \"Dr. Nietzsche\". \n He turned away from the influence of  , and after he severed his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of  , his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognised this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of   and distributed a fraction of them among close friends, including  .\n In 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the  . According to a letter he wrote to Peter Gast, this was due to his \"attitude towards Christianity and the concept of God\". \n In 1886, Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as \"completely buried and in this anti-Semitic dump\" of Schmeitzner—associating the publisher with a movement that should be \"utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind\".  He then printed   at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of  ,  ,  , and of   with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and imperceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met  ,  , and  .\n In 1886, his sister Elisabeth married the antisemite   and travelled to Paraguay to found  , a \"Germanic\" colony.  Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.\n In 1887, Nietzsche wrote the polemic  . During the same year, he encountered the work of  , to whom he felt an immediate kinship.  He also exchanged letters with   and  . Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of   in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to  , to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to   and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, Nietzsche slipped too far into illness. At the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.\n Although Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of   a new work with the title  , he seems to have abandoned this idea and, instead, used some of the draft passages to compose   and   in 1888. \n His health improved and he spent the summer in high spirits. In the autumn of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and \"fate\". He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic,  . On his 44th birthday, after completing   and  , he decided to write the autobiography  . In its preface—which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate—he declares, \"Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else.\"  In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with   and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation   and of the poems that made up his collection  .\n On 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a  .  Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of  . What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms around its neck to protect it, then collapsed to the ground.  In the following few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the   or   (literally \"Delusion notes\" or \"letters\")—to a number of friends including   and  . Most of them were signed \" \", though some were also signed \"der Gekreuzigte\" meaning \"the crucified one\". To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany,  writing also that the pope should be put in jail and that he, Nietzsche, created the world and was in the process of having all anti-Semites shot dead. \n On 6 January 1889, Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness,  and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in   under the direction of  .  In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of  , by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian   attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition.  Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and, in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg.  During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of  , but the publisher C. G. Naumann secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing   and   because of their more radical content.  Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge. \n In 1893, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth returned from   in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband. She studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of their publication. Overbeck was dismissed and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in  , where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including   (who in 1895 had written  , one of the first books praising Nietzsche),  to meet her uncommunicative brother. Elisabeth employed Steiner as a tutor to help her to understand her brother's philosophy. Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy. \n Nietzsche's insanity was originally diagnosed as  , in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time. Although most commentators  regard his breakdown as unrelated to his philosophy,   dropped dark hints (\"'Man incarnate' must also go mad\")  and  's postmortem psychoanalysis posits a worshipful rivalry with  .  Nietzsche had previously written, \"All superior men who were irresistibly drawn to throw off the yoke of any kind of morality and to frame new laws had, if they were not actually mad, no alternative but to make themselves or pretend to be mad.\" (Daybreak, 14) The diagnosis of syphilis has since been challenged and a diagnosis of \"  with periodic   followed by  \" was put forward by Cybulska prior to Schain's study.    suggested the slow growth of a right-sided retro-orbital   as an explanation of Nietzsche's dementia;  Orth and Trimble postulated   while other researchers have proposed a hereditary stroke disorder called  .  Poisoning by  , a treatment for syphilis at the time of Nietzsche's death,  has also been suggested. \n In 1898 and 1899, Nietzsche suffered at least two strokes. They partially paralysed him, leaving him unable to speak or walk. He likely suffered from clinical  /hemiplegia on the left side of his body by 1899. After contracting   in mid-August 1900, he had another stroke during the night of 24–25 August and died at about noon on 25 August.  Elisabeth had him buried beside his father at the church in   near  . His friend and secretary Gast gave his funeral oration, proclaiming: \"Holy be your name to all future generations!\" \n  compiled   from Nietzsche's unpublished notebooks and published it posthumously in 1901. Because his sister arranged the book based on her own conflation of several of Nietzsche's early outlines and took liberties with the material, the scholarly consensus has been that it does not reflect Nietzsche's intent. (For example, Elisabeth removed aphorism 35 of  , where Nietzsche rewrote a passage of the Bible.) Indeed,  , the editor of Nietzsche's  , called it a forgery.  Yet, the endeavour to rescue Nietzsche's reputation by discrediting   often leads to scepticism about the value of his late notes, even of his whole  . However, his   and   are distinct. \n General commentators and Nietzsche scholars, whether emphasising his cultural background or his language, overwhelmingly label Nietzsche as a \"German philosopher.\"  Others do not assign him a national category.  While Germany had not yet been unified into a single sovereign state, Nietzsche was born a citizen of  , which was mostly part of the  .  His birthplace,  , is in the modern German state of  . When he accepted his post at Basel, Nietzsche applied for annulment of his Prussian citizenship.  The official revocation of his citizenship came in a document dated 17 April 1869,  and for the rest of his life he remained officially  .\n At least toward the end of his life, Nietzsche believed his ancestors were  .  He wore a   bearing the  , traceable back to   of medieval times  and the surname \"Nicki\" of the Polish noble ( ) family bearing that coat of arms.  Gotard Nietzsche, a member of the Nicki family, left Poland for  . His descendants later settled in the   circa the year 1700.  Nietzsche wrote in 1888, \"My ancestors were Polish noblemen (Nietzky); the type seems to have been well preserved despite three generations of German mothers.\"  At one point, Nietzsche became even more adamant about his Polish identity. \"I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood.\"  On yet another occasion, Nietzsche stated, \"Germany is a great nation only because its people have so much Polish blood in their veins.... I am proud of my Polish descent.\"  Nietzsche believed his name might have been  , in one letter claiming, \"I was taught to ascribe the origin of my blood and name to Polish noblemen who were called Niëtzky and left their home and nobleness about a hundred years ago, finally yielding to unbearable suppression: they were  .\" \n Most scholars dispute Nietzsche's account of his family's origins. Hans von Müller debunked the genealogy put forward by Nietzsche's sister in favour of Polish noble heritage.   , Nietzsche's cousin and curator of the   at  , argued that all of Nietzsche's ancestors bore German names, including the wives' families.  Oehler claims that Nietzsche came from a long line of German   clergymen on both sides of his family, and modern scholars regard the claim of Nietzsche's Polish ancestry as \"pure invention.\"  Colli and Montinari, the editors of Nietzsche's assembled letters, gloss Nietzsche's claims as a \"mistaken belief\" and \"without foundation.\"  The name   itself is not a Polish name, but an exceptionally common one throughout central Germany, in this and cognate forms (such as   and  ). The name derives from the forename   abbreviated to  ; assimilated with the Slavic  ; it first became   and then  . \n It is not known why Nietzsche wanted to be thought of as Polish nobility. According to biographer  , Nietzsche's propagation of the Polish ancestry myth may have been part of his \"campaign against Germany.\"  Nicholas D. More states that Nietzsche's claims of having an illustrious lineage were a parody on autobiographical conventions, and suspects  , with its self-laudatory titles, such as \" \", as being a work of satire.  He concludes that Nietzsche's supposed Polish genealogy was a joke—not a delusion. \n Nietzsche was never married. He proposed to   three times and each time was rejected.  One theory blames Salomé's view on sexuality as one of the reasons for her alienation from Nietzsche. As articulated in her 1898 novella  , Salomé viewed the idea of sexual intercourse as prohibitive and marriage as a violation, with some suggesting that they indicated   and  .  Reflecting on  , Nietzsche considered that \"indispensable ... to the lover is his unrequited love, which he would at no price relinquish for a state of indifference\". \n Deussen cited the episode of  's brothel in February 1865 as instrumental to understanding the philosopher's way of thinking, mostly about women. Nietzsche was surreptitiously accompanied to a \"call house\" from which he clumsily escaped upon seeing \"a half dozen apparitions dressed in sequins and veils.\" According to Deussen, Nietzsche \"never decided to remain unmarried all his life. For him, women had to sacrifice themselves to the care and benefit of men.\"  Nietzsche scholar   has attempted to explain Nietzsche's life history and philosophy by claiming that he was homosexual. Köhler argues that Nietzsche's supposed syphilis, which is \"... usually considered to be the product of his encounter with a prostitute in a brothel in   or  , is equally likely. Some maintain that Nietzsche contracted it in a male brothel in  .\"  The acquisition of the infection from a homosexual brothel was the theory believed by  , who cited Otto Binswanger as his source.  Köhler also suggests that Nietzsche had a romantic relationship, as well as a friendship, with  .  There is the claim that Nietzsche's homosexuality was widely known in the  , with Nietzsche's friend   claiming that \"he was a man who had never touched a woman.\" \n Köhler's views have not found wide acceptance among Nietzsche scholars and commentators. Allan Megill argues that, while Köhler's claim that Nietzsche was conflicted about his homosexual desire cannot simply be dismissed, \"the evidence is very weak,\" and Köhler may be projecting twentieth-century understandings of sexuality on nineteenth-century notions of friendship.  It is also rumoured that Nietzsche frequented   brothels.    and   have argued that continuous sickness and headaches hindered Nietzsche from engaging much with women. Yet they offer other examples in which Nietzsche expressed his affections to women, including Wagner's wife  . \n Other scholars have argued that Köhler's sexuality-based interpretation is not helpful in understanding Nietzsche's philosophy.  However, there are also those who stress that, if Nietzsche preferred men—with this preference constituting his   make-up—but could not admit his desires to himself, it meant he acted in conflict with his philosophy. \n Because of Nietzsche's evocative style and provocative ideas, his philosophy generates passionate reactions. His works remain controversial, due to varying interpretations and misinterpretations. In Western philosophy, Nietzsche's writings have been described as a case of free revolutionary thought, that is, revolutionary in its structure and problems, although not tied to any revolutionary project.  His writings have also been described as a revolutionary project in which his philosophy serves as the foundation of a European cultural rebirth. \n The   is a two-fold philosophical concept based on two figures in ancient Greek mythology,   and  . This relationship takes the form of a  .  Even though the concept is related to  , the poet   had already spoken of it, and   had talked of  .\n Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that   the pessimism found in the so-called  . The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. The main theme in   is that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian   (\"artistic impulses\") forms dramatic arts or tragedies. He argued that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek  . Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity, logic and the  , whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion, ecstasy and unity (hence the omission of the principle of individuation). Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other, formed principles that were fundamental to the  :  the Apollonian a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian a state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mould, a man appears as the  . He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of   and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction. \n Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions appear in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make (Apollonian) order of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled. Elaborating on the conception of   as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and is a living   to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses the knowledge that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost; he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this. For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense what Nietzsche called the  , which revives Dionysian nature. He describes primordial unity as the increase of strength, the experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by  . Frenzy acts as intoxication and is crucial for the   condition that enables the creation of any art.  Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:\n Nietzsche is adamant that the works of   and   represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realisation of tragedy; it is with  , that tragedy begins its   (literally 'going under' or 'downward-way;' meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of   and   in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of ethics and   robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian.   emphasised reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge.   continued along this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses found in the Apollonian and Dionysian dichotomy. He notes that without the Apollonian, the Dionysian lacks the form and structure to make a coherent piece of art, and without the Dionysian, the Apollonian lacks the necessary vitality and passion. Only the fertile interplay of these two forces brought together as an art represented the best of Greek tragedy. \n An example of the impact of this idea can be seen in the book  , where anthropologist   acknowledges Nietzschean opposites of \"Apollonian\" and \"Dionysian\" as the stimulus for her thoughts about  .    has written extensively on the dichotomy in  .    commented that his own book   should be read \"under the sun of the great Nietzschean inquiry\". Here Foucault referenced Nietzsche's description of the birth and death of tragedy and his explanation that the subsequent tragedy of the Western world was the refusal of the tragic and, with that, refusal of the sacred.  Painter   was influenced by Nietzsche's view of tragedy presented in  \n Nietzsche claimed the   would eventually lead to the realisation that there can never be a universal perspective on things and that the traditional idea of   is incoherent.  Nietzsche rejected the idea of objective reality, arguing that knowledge is   and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests.  This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.  This view has acquired the name  .\n In  , Nietzsche proclaimed that a table of values hangs above every great person. He pointed out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one person to the next. Nietzsche asserted that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willingness is more essential than the merit of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. \"A thousand goals have there been so far\", says Zarathustra, \"for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.\" Hence, the title of the aphorism, \"On The Thousand And One Goal\". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science.   and   absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavours, as well as their political understanding. Weber, for example, relied on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible—but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established. \n Among his critique of traditional philosophy of  ,  , and   in  , Nietzsche attacked the   and   (\"I think, therefore I am\") as   beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and  .  Philosopher   put Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy. While criticising nihilism and Nietzsche together as a sign of general decay,  he still commended him for recognising psychological motives behind Kant and  's moral philosophy: \n In   and  , Nietzsche's   account of the development of modern moral systems occupies a central place. For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during the human history from thinking in terms of \"good and bad\" toward \"good and evil\".\n The initial form of morality was set by a warrior   and other ruling castes of ancient civilisations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower   such as slaves. Nietzsche presented this \"master morality\" as the original system of morality—perhaps best associated with   Greece.  To be \"good\" was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be \"bad\" was to be like the slaves over whom the aristocracy ruled: poor, weak, sick, pathetic—objects of pity or disgust rather than hatred. \n \"Slave morality\" developed as a reaction to master morality. Value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; while evil is worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche saw slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, its values emerging to improve the self-perception of slaves. He associated slave morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, as it is born out of the   of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own conditions without despising themselves. By denying the inherent inequality of people—in success, strength, beauty, and intelligence—slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting master morality, which frustrated them. It was used to overcome the slave's sense of inferiority before their (better-off) masters. It does so by depicting slave weakness, for example, as a matter of choice, by relabelling it as \"meekness\". The \"good man\" of master morality is precisely the \"evil man\" of slave morality, while the \"bad man\" is recast as the \"good man\". \n Nietzsche saw slave morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both contradictory values determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are \" \"). Nietzsche called for exceptional people not to be ashamed in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautioned, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses and should be left to them. Exceptional people, in contrast, should follow their own \"inner law\".  A favourite motto of Nietzsche, taken from  , reads: \"Become what you are.\" \n A long-standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, eminent Nietzsche scholar   rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were used only in a   and historic sense; they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorification.  On the other hand, Nietzsche called master morality \"a higher order of values, the noble ones, those that say Yes to life, those that guarantee the future\".  Just as \"there is an order of rank between man and man\", there is also an order of rank \"between morality and morality\".  Nietzsche waged a philosophic war against the slave morality of Christianity in his \"revaluation of all values\" to bring about the victory of a new master morality that he called the \"philosophy of the future\" (  is subtitled  ). \n In  , Nietzsche began his \"Campaign against Morality\".  He called himself an \"immoralist\" and harshly criticised the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity,  , and  . Nietzsche's concept \" \" applies to the doctrines of  , though not to all other faiths: he claimed that   is a successful religion that he complimented for fostering critical thought.  Still, Nietzsche saw his philosophy as a counter-movement to nihilism through appreciation of art:\n Nietzsche claimed that the Christian faith as practised was not a proper representation of Jesus' teachings, as it forced people merely to believe in the way of Jesus but not to act as Jesus did; in particular, his example of refusing to judge people, something that Christians constantly did.  He condemned institutionalised Christianity for emphasising a morality of   ( ), which assumes an inherent illness in society: \n In   Nietzsche called the establishment of moral systems based on a dichotomy of   a \"calamitous error\",  and wished to initiate a   of the   of the Christian world.  He indicated his desire to bring about a new, more naturalistic source of value in the vital impulses of life itself.\n While Nietzsche attacked the principles of Judaism, he was not  : in his work  , he explicitly condemned antisemitism and pointed out that his attack on Judaism was not an attack on contemporary Jewish people but specifically an attack upon the ancient Jewish priesthood who he claimed   paradoxically based their views upon.  An Israeli historian who performed a statistical analysis of everything Nietzsche wrote about Jews claims that cross-references and context make clear that 85% of the negative comments are attacks on Christian doctrine or, sarcastically, on Richard Wagner. \n Nietzsche felt that modern antisemitism was \"despicable\" and contrary to European ideals.  Its cause, in his opinion, was the growth in European nationalism and the endemic \"jealousy and hatred\" of Jewish success.  He wrote that Jews should be thanked for helping uphold a respect for the philosophies of ancient Greece,  and for giving rise to \"the noblest human being (Christ), the purest philosopher ( ), the mightiest book, and the most effective moral code in the world\". \n The statement \"God is dead,\" occurring in several of Nietzsche's works (notably in  ), has become one of his best-known remarks. On the basis of it, many commentators  regard Nietzsche as an  ; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement might reflect a more subtle understanding of divinity. Scientific developments and the increasing   of Europe had effectively 'killed' the   God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright  , the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. While Nietzsche rejected the traditional Christian morality and theology, he also rejected the nihilism which many thought was the only alternative to it.\n Nietzsche believed that Christian moral doctrine was originally constructed to counteract nihilism. It provides people with traditional beliefs about the   of good and evil, belief in God (whose existence one might appeal to in   the evil in the world), and a framework with which one might claim to have  . In constructing a world where objective knowledge is supposed to be possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism—the despair of meaninglessness. As   put the problem, \"If God as the supra sensory ground and goal of all reality is dead if the supra sensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalising and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself.\" \n One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche called  , which he recognised in the   philosophy of  . Schopenhauer's doctrine—which Nietzsche also referred to as  —advocates separating oneself from will and desires to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterised this   attitude as a \"will to nothingness\". Life turns away from itself as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although, in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent; this \"will to nothingness\" is still a (disavowed) form of willing. \n Nietzsche approached the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world had \"become conscious\" in him.  Furthermore, he emphasised the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that \"I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes a master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!\"  According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is   that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interpreted the death of God with what he explained as the death of  . He concluded that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement \"God is dead.\" \n Scholars such as   and   have aligned Nietzsche's religious thought with   thinkers, particularly those of the   tradition.  Occasionally, Nietzsche has also been considered in relation to Catholic mystics such as  .  Milne has argued against such interpretations on the grounds that such thinkers from Western and Eastern religious traditions strongly emphasise the divestment of will and the loss of ego, while Nietzsche offers a robust defence of egoism.  Milne argues that Nietzsche's religious thought is better understood in relation to his self-professed ancestors: \" ,  ,  ,  \".  Milne plays particularly close attention to Nietzsche's relationship to Goethe, who has typically been neglected in research by academic philosophers. Milne shows that Goethe's views on the one and the many allow a reciprocal determinism between part and whole, meaning that a claimed identity between part and whole does not give the part value solely in terms of belonging to the whole. In essence, this allows for a unitive sense of the individual's relationship to the universe, while also fostering a sense of \"self-esteem\" which Nietzsche found lacking in mystics such as Eckhart. \n With regard to Nietzsche's development of thought, it has been noted in research that although he dealt with \"nihilistic\" themes (\"pessimism, with nirvana and with nothingness and non-being\" ) from 1869 onwards, a conceptual use of nihilism first took place in handwritten notes in mid-1880. This period saw the publication of a then popular work that reconstructed so-called \"Russian nihilism\" on the basis of Russian newspaper reports (N. Karlowitsch: The Development of Nihilism. Berlin 1880), which is significant for Nietzsche's terminology . \n A basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the \"will to power\" ( ), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behaviour—more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.  As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behaviour only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of a 'struggle for existence.'  More often than not, self-conservation is a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.\n In presenting his theory of human behaviour, Nietzsche also addressed and attacked concepts from philosophies then popularly embraced, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of  . Utilitarians claim that what moves people is the desire to be happy and accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,  and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim  . It is a consequence of overcoming hurdles to one's actions and the fulfilment of the will. \n Related to his theory of the will to power is his speculation, which he did not deem final,  regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter—that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of  —the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seemed to have accepted the conclusions of  , who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.  One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as \"the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation\" revealing the will to power as \"the principle of the synthesis of forces\".  Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise, he rejected the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces. \n Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power: Nietzsche thoroughly criticised metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than Aphorism 36 in  , where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, they argue, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. And they also claim that Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria.  According to these scholars, the \"burning\" story supports their thesis that Nietzsche rejected his project on the will to power at the end of his lucid life. However, a recent study (Huang 2019) shows that although it is true that in 1888 Nietzsche wanted some of his notes burned, this indicates little about his project on the will to power, not only because only 11 \"aphorisms\" saved from the flames were ultimately incorporated into   (this book contains 1067 \"aphorisms\"), but also because these abandoned notes mainly focus on topics such as the critique of morality while touching upon the \"feeling of power\" only once. \n \"Eternal return\" (also known as \"eternal recurrence\") is a hypothetical concept that posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely   concept, involving no supernatural  , but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first proposed the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of  , and also in the chapter \"Of the Vision and the Riddle\" in  , among other places.  Nietzsche considered it as potentially \"horrifying and paralyzing\", and said that its burden is the \"heaviest weight\" imaginable (\" \").  The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to  's praise of denying the will-to-live. To comprehend eternal recurrence, and to not only come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires  , \"love of fate\".  As   pointed out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence presents this concept as a   rather than stating it as fact. According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the   of eternal recurrence – the mere possibility of it, and the reality of speculating on that possibility – which is so significant in modern thought: \"The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.'\" \n  writes in   of three ways of seeing the eternal recurrence:\n Nehamas concluded that, if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions.  Nietzsche's thought is the negation of the idea of a history of salvation. \n Another concept important to understanding Nietzsche is the   (Superman).  Writing about nihilism in  , Nietzsche introduced an  . According to  , \"the death of God must be followed by a long twilight of piety and nihilism (II. 19; III. 8). Zarathustra's gift of the overman is given to mankind not aware of the problem to which the overman is the solution.\"  Zarathustra presents the   as the creator of new values, and he appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. The   does not follow the morality of common people since that favours mediocrity but rises above the notion of   and above the \" \".  In this way Zarathustra proclaims his ultimate goal as the journey towards the state of the  . He wants a kind of spiritual evolution of self-awareness and overcoming of traditional views on morality and justice that stem from the   beliefs still deeply rooted or related to the notion of God and Christianity. \n From   (Zarathustra's Prologue; pp. 9–11): \n Zarathustra contrasts the   with the   of egalitarian modernity (the most obvious example being democracy), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an   creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in  , and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the   impossible. \n Some  have suggested that the eternal return is related to the  , since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the   is to create new values untainted by the spirit of gravity or  . Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval, yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the  , in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognising it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the   to will the eternal recurrence. Only the   will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n The Nazis attempted to incorporate the concept into their ideology by means of taking Nietzsche's figurative form of speech and creating a literal superiority over other ethnicities. After his death,   became the curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own   ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly  . Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with   and  ;  20th-century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available.\n Although Nietzsche has been misrepresented as a predecessor to Nazism, he criticised antisemitism,   and, to a lesser extent,  .  Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's antisemitic stances, and his rupture with  , expressed in   and  , both of which he wrote in 1888, had much to do with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and antisemitism—and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a 29 March 1887 letter to  , Nietzsche mocked antisemites, Fritsch,  , Wagner, Ebrard,  , and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism,  , who would become, along with Wagner and  , the main official influences of  .  This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: \"And finally, how do you think I feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites?\"  In contrast to these examples, Nietzsche's close friend   recalled in his memoirs, \"When he speaks frankly, the opinions he expresses about Jews go, in their severity, beyond any anti-Semitism. The foundation of his anti-Christianity is essentially anti-Semitic.\" \n Friedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view of modern society and culture. He believed that the press and mass culture led to conformity and brought about mediocrity, and that the lack of intellectual progress was leading to the decline of the human species. In his opinion, some people would be able to become superior individuals through the use of willpower. By rising above mass culture, those persons would produce higher, brighter, and healthier human beings. \n A trained philologist, Nietzsche had a thorough knowledge of  . He read  ,  ,  ,   and  ,  who became the main opponents in his philosophy, and later engaged, via the work of   in particular, with the thought of  , whom he saw as his \"precursor\" in many respects  but as a personification of the \"ascetic ideal\" in others. However, Nietzsche referred to Kant as a \"moral fanatic\", Plato as \"boring\", Mill as a \"blockhead\", and of Spinoza, he asked: \"How much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray?\"  He likewise expressed contempt for British author  . \n Nietzsche's philosophy, while innovative and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors. While at Basel, Nietzsche lectured on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterised as a \"lost link\" in the development of his thought. \"In it, concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonic, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche.\"  The   thinker   was known for rejecting the concept of   as a constant and eternal principle of the universe and embracing \"flux\" and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as \"child play\" marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.  Due to his Heraclitean sympathies, Nietzsche was also a vociferous critic of  , who, in contrast to Heraclitus, viewed the world as a single, unchanging Being. \n In his  ,   claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was \"an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong. These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche.\" \n The superficial similarity of Nietzsche's   to  's Hero as well as both authors' rhetorical prose style has led to speculation concerning the degree to which Nietzsche might have been influenced by his reading of Carlyle.    believed that \"Out of [Carlyle] flows most of the philosophy of Nietzsche\", qualifying his statement by adding that they were \"profoundly different\" in character.    has shown that Carlyle anticipated Nietzsche in asserting the importance of metaphor (with Nietzsche's metaphor-fiction theory \"appear[ing] to owe something to Carlyle\"), announcing the death of God, and recognising both Goethe's   (renunciation) and  's   (self-annihilation) as prerequisites for engaging in philosophy. apRoberts writes that \"Nietzsche and Carlyle had the same German sources, but Nietzsche may owe more to Carlyle than he cares to admit\", noting that \"[Nietzsche] takes the trouble to repudiate Carlyle with malicious emphasis.\"  Ralph Jessop,   at the  , has recently argued that a reassessment of Carlyle's influence on Nietzsche is \"long-overdue\". \n Nietzsche expressed admiration for 17th-century French moralists such as  ,   and  ,  as well as for  .  The   of   influenced Nietzsche,  as did that of   and  .  In 1867 Nietzsche wrote in a letter that he was trying to improve his German style of writing with the help of  ,   and Schopenhauer. It was probably Lichtenberg (along with  ) whose aphoristic style of writing contributed to Nietzsche's own use of  .  Nietzsche early learned of   through  .  The essays of   had a profound influence on Nietzsche, who \"loved Emerson from first to last\",  wrote \"Never have I felt so much at home in a book\", and called him \"[the] author who has been richest in ideas in this century so far\".    influenced Nietzsche's view on   and  .  Notably, he also read some of the posthumous works of  ,   's  ,  's  , and  's  .  Nietzsche called Dostoyevsky \"the only psychologist from whom I have anything to learn\".  While Nietzsche never mentions  , the similarities in their ideas have prompted a minority of interpreters to suggest a  . \n In 1861, Nietzsche wrote an enthusiastic essay on his \"favorite poet,\"  , mostly forgotten at that time.  He also expressed deep appreciation for Stifter's  ,  Byron's   and Twain's  . \n A   translation of the Calcutta version of the ancient Hindu text called the   was reviewed by Friedrich Nietzsche. He commented on it both favourably and unfavorably:\n Nietzsche's works did not reach a wide readership during his active writing career. However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic   aroused considerable excitement about Nietzsche through a series of lectures he gave at the  . In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.  Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater   and personality development in  , but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894–1895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as  . During the late 19th century Nietzsche's ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France, Germany,  Great Britain and the United States.    is credited with the most in-depth appreciation and critique of Nietzsche's ideas from an anarchist perspective.    produced the first book on Nietzsche in English in 1907,  , and in 1910 a book of translated paragraphs from Nietzsche, increasing knowledge of his philosophy in the United States.  Nietzsche is known today as a precursor to  ,   and  . \n  and   described Nietzsche as the intellectual heir to  .
